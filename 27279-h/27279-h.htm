<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><small>HE</small> primary object of this book is to furnish our children
with material for becoming acquainted with the development
of American life and history as found in Southern
writers and their works. It may serve as a reader supplementary
to American history and literature, or it may be
made the ground-work for serious study of Southern life
and letters; and between these extremes there are varying
degrees of usefulness.</p>

<p>To state its origin will best explain its existence. This
may furthermore be of some help to teachers in using the
book, though each teacher will use it as best suits his classes
and methods.</p>

<p>The study of History is rising every day in importance.
Sir Walter Raleigh in his &ldquo;Historie of the World&rdquo; well
said, &ldquo;It hath triumphed over time, which besides it nothing
but eternity hath triumphed over.&rdquo; It is the still living
word of the vanished ages.</p>

<p>The best way of teaching history has of late years received
much attention. One excellent method is to read, in
connection with the text-book, good works of fiction, dramas,
poetry, and historical novels, bearing upon the different
epochs, and also to read the works of the authors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
themselves of these different periods. We thus make history
and literature illustrate and beautify each other. The dry
dates become covered with living facts, the past is peopled
with real beings instead of hard names, fiction receives a
solid basis for its airy architecture, and the mind of the
pupil is interested and broadened. Even the difficult subjects
of politics and institutions gradually assume a more
pleasing aspect by being associated with individual human
interests, and condescend to simplify themselves through
personal relations.</p>

<p>To illustrate this method, which I have used with great
success in teaching English History:</p>

<p>In connection with the times of the early Britons, read
Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Idyls of the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the Norman Conquest, Bulwer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Harold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the reign of Richard I. (Coeur de Lion), Scott&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ivanhoe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Talisman,&rdquo; Shakspere&rsquo;s &ldquo;King John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the reign of Elizabeth, Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kenilworth,&rdquo; the non-historical
plays of Shakspere, as he lived at that epoch, Bacon&rsquo;s
Essays, and others.</p>

<p>I mention merely a few. The amount of reading can be
increased almost indefinitely and will depend on the time
of the pupil, the plan of the teacher, and the accessibility
of the books. Most of the books necessary for English
History are now published in cheap form and are within
reach of every pupil.</p>

<p>A great deal of reading is very desirable; it is the only
way to give our pupils any broad view of literature and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
history, and to cultivate a taste for reading in those destitute
of it. It is often the only opportunity for reading
which some pupils will ever have, and it lasts them a life-time
as a pleasure and a benefit.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The reading may be done in the class or out of school
hours. It is well to read as much as practicable in class,
and to have some sketch of the outside reading given in
class.</p>

<p>Geography must also go hand in hand with history, a
point now well understood. But its importance can hardly
be exaggerated and its practice is of the utmost value. One
<em>must</em> use maps to study and read intelligently.</p>

<p>In American History pursue a similar course, as for example:</p>

<p>At the period of discovery and early settlement, read
Irving&rsquo;s &ldquo;Columbus,&rdquo; Simms&rsquo; &ldquo;Vasconselos&rdquo; (De Soto&rsquo;s
Expedition), and &ldquo;Yemassee,&rdquo; John Smith&rsquo;s Life and
Writings, Longfellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hiawatha&rdquo; and &ldquo;Miles Standish,&rdquo;
Kennedy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rob of the Bowl,&rdquo; Strachey&rsquo;s Works, Mrs.
Preston&rsquo;s &ldquo;Colonial Ballads,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>In Revolutionary times, the Revolutionary novels of
Simms and Cooper, Kennedy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Horse-Shoe Robinson;&rdquo;
the great statesmen of the day, as Jefferson, Adams, Patrick
Henry, Hamilton, Washington; Cooke&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fairfax&rdquo; in
which Washington appears as a youthful surveyor, and
&ldquo;Virginia Comedians&rdquo; in which Patrick Henry appears,
Thackeray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Virginians;&rdquo; and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
Each teacher will make his own list as his time and
command of books allow. And each State or section of
our great country will devote more time to its own special
history and literature; this is right, for knowledge like
charity begins at home, and gradually widens until it embraces
the circle of the universe.</p>

<p>In collecting material for classes in American History to
read in accordance with this plan, it was found easy to get
cheap editions of Irving, Longfellow, Cooper, and other
writers of the northern States, but almost impossible to get
those of the southern, in cheap or even expensive editions.
And the present volume has been prepared to supply in
part this deficiency. To fit it to the plan suggested, the dates
of the writers and the period and character of their works
have been indicated, and some selections from them given
for reading,&mdash;too little, it is feared, to be of much service,
and yet enough to stimulate to further interest and study.</p>

<p>The materials have been found so abundant, even so much
more abundant than I suspected when undertaking the work,
that it has been a hard task to make a selection from the
rich masses of interesting writing. I fear that the work is
too fragmentary and contains too many writers to make a
lasting impression in a historical point of view.</p>

<p>If, however, it leads to a sympathetic study of Southern
life and literature, and especially if it makes young people
acquainted with our writers of the past and with something
of the old-time life and the spirit that controlled our ancestors,
it will serve an excellent purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
Our writers should be compared with those of other sections
and other countries; and due honor should be given
them, equally removed from over-praise and from depreciation.
If we, their countrymen, do not know and honor
them, who can be expected to do so? No people is great
whose memory is lost, whose interest centres in the present
alone, who looks not reverently back to true beginnings and
hopefully forward to a grand future.</p>

<p>So I would urge my fellow-teachers to a fresh diligence
in studying and worthily understanding the life and literature
of our past, and in impressing them upon the minds
of the rising generation, so as to infuse into the new forms
now arising the best and purest and highest of the old forms
fast passing away.</p>

<p>My sincere thanks are hereby tendered to the scholars
who have aided me by their advice and encouragement, to
living authors and the relatives of those not living who
have generously given me permission to copy extracts
from their writings, to the publishers who have kindly
allowed me to use copyrighted matter, to Miss Anna M.
Trice, Mr. Josiah Ryland, Jr., and the officials of the Virginia
State Library where I found most of the books needed
in my work, and to Mr. David Hutcheson, of the Library
of Congress. My greatest indebtedness is to Professor William
Taylor Thom and Professor John P. McGuire, for
scholarly criticism and practical suggestions in the course of
preparation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain John Smith</span>, the first writer of Virginia, was born
at Willoughby, England, and led a life of rare and extensive
adventure. &ldquo;Lamenting and repenting,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to
have seen so many Christians slaughter one another,&rdquo; in
France and the Lowlands, he enlisted in the wars against
the Turks. He was captured by them and held prisoner
for a year, but escaped and travelled all over Europe. He
finally joined the expedition to colonize Virginia, and
came over with the first settlers of Jamestown in 1607.
His life here is well known; he remained with the colony
two years. He afterwards returned to America as Admiral
of New England, but did not stay long. He spent the remainder
of his life in writing accounts of himself and his
travels, and of the colonies in America.</p>

<p>Captain Smith&rsquo;s style is honest and hearty in tone, picturesque,
often amusing, never tiresome. It is involved and
ungrammatical at times, but not obscure. The critics have
professed to find many inaccuracies of historical statement;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
but the following, from Professor Edward Arber, the editor
of the English Reprint of Smith&rsquo;s Works, will acquit him
of this charge:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Inasmuch as the accuracy of some of Captain Smith&rsquo;s statements
has, in this generation, been called in question, it was but our duty to
subject every one of the nearly forty thousand lines of this book to a
most searching criticism; scanning every assertion of fact most
keenly, and making the Text, by the insertion of a multitude of cross-references,
prove or disprove itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The result is perfectly satisfactory. Allowing for a popular style
of expression, the Text is homogeneous; and the nine books comprising
it, though written under very diverse circumstances, and at
intervals over the period of twenty-two years (1608-1630), contain no
material contradictions. Inasmuch, therefore, as wherever we <em>can</em>
check Smith, we find him both modest and accurate, we are led to
think him so, where no such check is possible, as at Nalbrits in
the autumn of 1603, and on the Chickahominy in the winter of
1607-&rsquo;8.&rdquo; See Life, by <i>Simms</i>, by <i>Warner</i>, and by <i>Eggleston</i> in

<p class="caption">Rescue of Captain Smith by Pocahontas.</p>

<p>At last they brought him [Smith] to <i>Meronocomoco</i>, where
was <i>Powhatan</i> their Emperor. Here more than two hundred
of those grim Courtiers stood wondering at him, as he
had beene a monster; till <i>Powhatan</i> and his trayne had put
themselues in their greatest braveries. Before a fire vpon
a seat like a bedstead, he sat covered with a great robe,
made of <i>Rarowcun</i> skinnes, and all the tayles hanging by.
On either hand did sit a young wench of 16 or 18 yeares;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
and along on each side the house, two rowes of men, and
behind them as many women, with all their heads and
shoulders painted red; many of their heads bedecked with
the white downe of Birds; but every one with something;
and a great chayne of white beads about their necks.</p>

<p>At his entrance before the King, all the people gaue a
great shout. The Queene of <i>Appamatuck</i> was appointed
to bring him water to wash his hands, and another brought
him a bunch of feathers, in stead of a Towell to dry them;
having feasted him after their best barbarous manner they
could, a long consultation was held, but the conclusion was,
two great stones were brought before <i>Powhatan</i>; then as
many as could layd hands on him, dragged him to them,
and thereon laid his head, and being ready with their clubs,
to beate out his braines, <i>Pocahontas</i>, the Kings dearest daughter,
when no intreaty could prevaile, got his head in her
armes, and laid her owne vpon his to saue him from death:
whereat the Emperour was contented he should liue to make
him hatchets, and her bells, beads, and copper; for they
thought him as well of all occupations as themselues. For the
King himselfe will make his owne robes, shooes, bowes, arrowes,
pots; plant, hunt, or doe anything so well as the rest.</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>Two dayes after, <i>Powhatan</i> having disguised himselfe in
the most fearefullest manner he could, caused Captain <i>Smith</i>
to be brought forth to a great house in the woods, and there
vpon a mat by the fire to be left alone. Not long after from
behinde a mat that divided the house, was made the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
dolefullest noyse he ever heard; then <i>Powhatan</i>, more like
a devill than a man, with some two hundred more as blacke
as himselfe, came vnto him and told him now they were
friends, and presently he should goe to <i>James</i> towne, to
send him two great gunnes, and a gryndstone, for which he
would giue him the Country of <i>Capahowosick</i>, and for ever
esteeme him as his sonne <i>Nantaquoud</i>.</p>

<p>So to <i>James</i> towne with 12 guides <i>Powhatan</i> sent him.
That night, they quartered in the woods, he still expecting
(as he had done all this long time of his imprisonment)
every houre to be put to one death or other; for all their
feasting. But almightie God (by his divine providence)
had mollified the hearts of those sterne <i>Barbarians</i> with
compassion. The next morning betimes they came to the
Fort, where <i>Smith</i> having vsed the Salvages with what
kindnesse he could, he shewed <i>Rawhunt</i>, <i>Powhatan&rsquo;s</i> trusty
servant, two demi-Culverings and a millstone to carry <i>Powhatan</i>;
they found them somewhat too heavie: but when
they did see him discharge them, being loaded with stones,
among the boughs of a great tree loaded with Isickles, the
yce and branches came so tumbling downe, that the poore
Salvages ran away halfe dead with feare. But at last we
regained some conference with them, and gaue them such
toyes: and sent to <i>Powhatan</i>, his women, and children such
presents, as gaue them in generall full content.</p>


<h3>OUR RIGHT TO THOSE COUNTRIES, TRUE REASONS FOR PLANTATIONS,
RARE EXAMPLES.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Advertisements for the Inexperienced.</i>)</p>

<p>Many good religious devout men have made it a great
question, as a matter in conscience, by what warrant they
might goe to possesse those Countries, which are none of
theirs, but the poore Salvages.</p>

<p class="subcap">The first permanent English settlement in America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
Which poore curiosity will answer it selfe; for God did
make the world to be inhabited with mankind, and to have
his name knowne to all Nations, and from generation to
generation: as the people increased, they dispersed themselves
into such Countries as they found most convenient.
And here in <i>Florida</i>, <i>Virginia</i>, <i>New-England</i>, and <i>Cannada</i>,
is more land than all the people in Christendome can
manure [<i>cultivate</i>], and yet more to spare than all the natives
of those Countries can use and culturate. And shall
we here keepe such a coyle for land, and at such great rents
and rates, when there is so much of the world uninhabited,
and as much more in other places, and as good or rather
better than any wee possesse, were it manured and used
accordingly?</p>

<p>If this be not a reason sufficient to such tender consciences;
for a copper knife and a few toyes, as beads and
hatchets, they will sell you a whole Countrey [<i>district</i>];
and for a small matter, their houses and the ground they
dwell upon; but those of the <i>Massachusets</i> have resigned
theirs freely.</p>

<p>Now the reasons for plantations are many. <i>Adam</i> and
<i>Eve</i> did first begin this innocent worke to plant the earth
to remaine to posterity; but not without labour, trouble,
and industry. Noah and his family began againe the second
plantation, and their seed as it still increased, hath still
planted new Countries, and one Country another, and so
the world to that estate it is; but not without much hazard,
travell, mortalities, discontents, and many disasters; had
those worthy Fathers and their memorable offspring not
beene more diligent for us now in those ages, than wee are
to plant that yet unplanted for after-livers: Had the seed
of <i>Abraham</i>, our Saviour Christ Jesus and his Apostles, exposed
themselves to no more dangers to plant the Gospell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
wee so much professe, than we; even we our selves had at
this moment beene as Salvages, and as miserable as the most
barbarous Salvage, yet uncivilized.</p>

<p>The <i>Hebrewes</i>, the <i>Lacedemonians</i>, the <i>Goths</i>, <i>Grecians</i>,
<i>Romans</i>, and the rest; what was it they would not undertake
to enlarge their Territories, inrich their subjects, and
resist their enemies? Those that were the founders of those
great Monarchies and their vertues, were no silvered idle
golden Pharisees, but industrious honest hearted Publicans;
they regarded more provisions and necessaries for their
people, than jewels, ease, and delight for themselves; riches
was their servants, not their masters; they ruled as fathers,
not as tyrants; their people as children, not as slaves; there
was no disaster could discourage them; and let none thinke
they incountered not with all manner of incumbrances; and
what hath ever beene the worke of the best great Princes
of the world, but planting of Countries, and civilizing barbarous
and inhumane Nations to civility and humanity;
whose eternall actions fils our histories with more honour
than those that have wasted and consumed them by
warres.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <i>Portugals</i> and <i>Spaniards</i> that first began
plantations in this unknowne world of <i>America</i> till within
this 140. yeares [1476-1616], whose everlasting actions before
our eyes, will testifie our idlenesse and ingratitude to all
posterity, and neglect of our duty and religion we owe our
God, our King, and Countrey, and want of charity to those
poore Salvages, whose Countries we challenge, use and possesse:
except wee be but made to marre what our forefathers
made; or but only tell what they did; or esteeme
our selves too good to take the like paines where there is so
much reason, liberty, and action offers it selfe. Having as
much power and meanes as others, why should English men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
despaire, and not doe as much as any? Was it vertue in
those Hero[e]s to provide that [which] doth maintaine us,
and basenesse in us to do the like for others to come?
Surely no: then seeing wee are not borne for ourselves but
each to helpe other; and our abilities are much alike at
the howre of our birth and the minute of our death: seeing
our good deeds or bad, by faith in Christs merits, is all wee
have to carry our soules to heaven or hell: Seeing honour
is our lives ambition, and our ambition after death to have
an honourable memory of our life; and seeing by no meanes
we would be abated of the dignitie and glory of our predecessors,
let us imitate their vertues to be worthily their successors;
or at least not hinder, if not further, them that
would and doe their utmost and best endeavour.</p>


<h3>ASCENT OF THE JAMES RIVER, 1607.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Newes from Virginia.</i>)</p>

<p>The two and twenty day of Aprill [<i>or rather May, 1607</i>],
Captain <i>Newport</i> and myself with diuers others, to the
number of twenty two persons, set forward to discouer the
Riuer, some fiftie or sixtie miles, finding it in some places
broader, and in some narrower, the Countrie (for the moste
part) on each side plaine high ground, with many freshe
Springes, the people in all places kindely intreating vs,
daunsing, and feasting vs with strawberries, Mulberies,
Bread, Fish, and other their Countrie prouisions whereof
we had plenty; for which Captaine <i>Newport</i> kindely requited
their least fauors with Bels, Pinnes, Needles, beades,
or Glasses, which so contented them that his liberallitie
made them follow vs from place to place, and euer kindely
to respect vs. In the midway staying to refresh our selues
in a little Ile foure or five sauages came vnto vs which described
vnto vs the course of the Riuer, and after in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
iourney, they often met vs, trading with vs for such prouision
as wee had, and arriuing at <i>Arsatecke</i>, hee whom we
supposed to bee the chiefe King of all the rest, moste kindely
entertained vs, giuing vs in a guide to go with vs vp the
Riuer to <i>Powhatan</i>, of which place their great Emperor
taketh his name, where he that they honored for King vsed
vs kindely.</p>

<p>But to finish this discouerie, we passed on further, where
within an ile [<i>a mile</i>] we were intercepted with great
craggy stones in the midst of the riuer, where the water
falleth so rudely, and with such a violence, as not any boat
can possibly passe, and so broad disperseth the streame, as
there is not past fiue or sixe Foote at a low water, and to
the shore scarce passage with a barge, the water floweth
foure foote, and the freshes by reason of the Rockes haue
left markes of the inundations 8. or 9. foote: The south
side is plaine low ground, and the north side high mountaines,
the rockes being of a grauelly nature, interlaced
with many vains of glistring spangles.</p>

<p>That night we returned to <i>Powhatan</i>: the next day (being
Whitsunday after dinner) we returned to the fals, leauing
a mariner in pawn with the Indians for a guide of theirs,
hee that they honoured for King followed vs by the riuer.
That afternoone we trifled in looking vpon the Rockes and
riuer (further he would not goe) so there we erected a crosse,
and that night taking our man at <i>Powhatans</i>, Captaine
<i>Newport</i> congratulated his kindenes with a Gown and a
Hatchet: returning to <i>Arsetecke</i>, and stayed there the next
day to obserue the height [<i>latitude</i>] thereof, and so with
many signes of loue we departed.</p>

<h3>A STORM OFF THE BERMUDAS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From A True Repertory of the Wracke and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates.</i>)</p>

<p>On St. James his day, July 24, being Monday (preparing
for no less all the black night before) the clouds
gathering thick upon us, and the winds singing and whistling
most unusually, which made us to cast off our Pinnace,
towing the same until then asterne, a dreadful storm
and hideous began to blow from out the Northeast, which,
swelling and roaring as it were by fits, some hours with
more violence than others, at length did beat all light from
heaven, which, like an hell of darkness, turned black upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
us, so much the more fuller of horror, as in such cases horror
and fear use to overrun the troubled and overmastered
senses of all, while (taken up with amazement) the ears
lay so sensible to the terrible cries, and murmurs of the
winds and distraction of our Company, as who was most
armed and best prepared, was not a little shaken.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>For four and twenty hours the storm, in a restless tumult,
had blown so exceedingly, as we could not apprehend in our
imaginations any possibility of greater violence, yet did we
still find it, not only more terrible, but more constant, fury
added to fury, and one storm urging a second, more outrageous
than the former, whether it so wrought upon our fears,
or indeed met with new forces. Sometimes strikes in our
Ship amongst women, and passengers not used to such hurly
and discomforts, made us look one upon the other with
troubled hearts, and panting bosoms, our clamors drowned
in the winds, and the winds in thunder. Prayers might
well be in the heart and lips, but drowned in the outcries of
the Officers,&mdash;nothing heard that could give comfort, nothing
seen that might encourage hope.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Our sails, wound up, lay without their use, and if at any
time we bore but a Hollocke, or half forecourse, to guide
her before the Sea, six and sometimes eight men, were not
enough to hold the whip-staffe in the steerage, and the tiller
below in the Gunner room; by which may be imagined
the strength of the storm, in which the Sea swelled above
the Clouds and gave battle unto heaven. It could not be
said to rain, the waters like whole Rivers did flood in the
ayre. And this I did still observe, that whereas upon the
Land, when a storm hath poured itself forth once in drifts of
rain, the wind as beaten down, and vanquished therewith,
not long after endureth,&mdash;here the glut of water (as if
throatling the wind ere while) was no sooner a little emptied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
and qualified, but instantly the winds (as having gotten
their mouths now free and at liberty) spake more loud, and
grew more tumultuous and malignant. What shall I say?
Winds and Seas were as mad as fury and rage could make
them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Howbeit this was not all; it pleased God to bring a
greater affliction yet upon us, for in the beginning of the
storm we had received likewise a mighty leak, and the ship
in every joint almost having spewed out her Okam, before
we were aware (a casualty more desperate than any other
that a Voyage by Sea draweth with it) was grown five feet
suddenly deep with water above her ballast, and we almost
drowned within, whilest we sat looking when to perish from
above. This, imparting no less terror than danger, ran
through the whole Ship with much fright and amazement,
startled and turned the blood, and took down the braves of
the most hardy Mariner of them all, insomuch as he that
before happily felt not the sorrow of others, now began to
sorrow for himself, when he saw such a pond of water so
suddenly broken in, and which he knew could not (with
present avoiding) but instantly sink him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Once so huge a Sea brake upon the poop and quarter,
upon us, as it covered our ship from stern to stem, like a
garment or a vast cloud. It filled her brimful for a while
within, from the hatches up to the spar deck.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Tuesday noon till Friday noon, we bailed and pumped two
thousand tun, and yet, do what we could, when our ship
held least in her (after Tuesday night second watch) she
bore ten feet deep, at which stay our extreme working kept
her one eight glasses, forbearance whereof had instantly sunk
us; and it being now Friday, the fourth morning, it wanted
little but that there had been a general determination, to have
shut up hatches and commending our sinful souls to God,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
committed the ship to the mercy of the sea. Surely that
night we must have done it, and that night had we then perished;
but see the goodness and sweet introduction of better
hope by our merciful God given unto us. Sir George Summers,
when no man dreamed of such happiness, had discovered
and cried, &ldquo;Land!&rdquo; Indeed, the morning, now three-quarters
spent, had won a little clearness from the days before,
and it being better surveyed, the very trees were seen to
move with the wind upon the shore-side.</p>

<h2>JOHN LAWSON.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>Died 1712.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">John Lawson</span> was a Scotch gentleman who came to
America in 1700. In his own words: &ldquo;In the year 1700,
when people flocked from all parts of the Christian world,
to see the solemnity of the grand jubilee at Rome, my intention
being at that time to travel, I accidentally met with
a gentlemen, who had been abroad, and was very well acquainted
with the ways of living in both Indies; of whom
having made inquiry concerning them, he assured me that
Carolina was the best country I could go to; and, that there
then lay a ship in the Thames in which I might have my
passage.&rdquo; He resided in Carolina eight years. As &ldquo;Gent.
Surveyor-General of North Carolina,&rdquo; he wrote his History
of North Carolina, which is an original, sprightly, and
faithful account of the eastern section of the State, and
contains valuable matter for the subsequent historian. It
is dedicated to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, and was
published in 1714.</p>

<p>He was taken captive by the Tuscarora Indians, while on
a surveying trip, and was by them put to death in 1712 on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
the Neuse River in North Carolina, because, said they, &ldquo;he

<h3>NORTH CAROLINA IN 1700-1708.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From History of North Carolina, 1714.</i>)</p>

<p>The first discovery and settlement of this country was by
the procurement of Sir Walter Raleigh, in conjunction with
some public spirited gentlemen of that age, under the protection
of queen Elizabeth; for which reason it was then
named Virginia, being begun on that part called Ronoak
Island, where the ruins of a fort are to be seen at this day,
as well as some old English coins which have been lately
found; and a brass gun, a powder horn, and one small
quarter-deck gun, made of iron staves, and hooped with the
same metal; which method of making guns might very
probably be made use of in those days for the convenience
of infant colonies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I cannot forbear inserting here a pleasant story that passes
for an uncontested truth amongst the inhabitants of this
place; which is, that the ship which brought the first colonies
does often appear amongst them, under sail, in a gallant
posture, which they call Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s ship. And
the truth of this has been affirmed to me by men of the
best credit in the country.</p>

<p class="caption">Sir Walter Raleigh.</p>

<p>A second settlement of this country was made about fifty
years ago, in that part we now call Albemarl county, and
chiefly in Chuwon precinct, by several substantial planters
from Virginia and other plantations; who finding mild
winters, and a fertile soil beyond expectation, producing
everything that was planted to a prodigious increase;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
so that everything seemed to come by nature, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
husbandman living almost void of care, and free from those
fatigues which are absolutely requisite in winter countries,
for providing fodder and other necessaries; these encouragements
induced them to stand their ground, although but
a handful of people, seated at great distances one from
another, and amidst a vast number of Indians of different
nations, who were then in Carolina.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I say, the fame of this new discovered summer
country spread through the neighboring colonies, and
in a few years drew a considerable number of families
thereto, who all found land enough to settle themselves in
(had they been many thousands more), and that which was
very good and commodiously seated both for profit and
pleasure.</p>

<p>And, indeed, most of the plantations in Carolina naturally
enjoy a noble prospect of large and spacious rivers,
pleasant savannas and fine meadows, with their green liveries
interwoven with beautiful flowers of most glorious
colors, which the several seasons afford; hedged in with
pleasant groves of the ever famous tulip tree, the stately
laurels and bays, equalizing the oak in bigness and growth,
myrtles, jessamines, woodbines, honeysuckles, and several
other fragrant vines and evergreens, whose aspiring branches
shadow and interweave themselves with the loftiest timbers,
yielding a pleasant prospect, shade and smell, proper habitations
for the sweet singing birds, that melodiously entertain
such as travel through the woods of Carolina.</p>

<p>The Planters possessing all these blessings, and the produce
of great quantities of wheat and indian corn, in which
this country is very fruitful, as likewise in beef, pork, tallow,
hides, deer skins, and furs; for these commodities the
new England men and Bermudians visited Carolina in their
barks and sloops, and carried out what they made, bringing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
them in exchange, rum, sugar, salt, molasses, and some
wearing apparel, though the last at very extravagant prices.</p>

<p>As the land is very fruitful, so are the planters kind and
hospitable to all that come to visit them; there being very
few housekeepers but what live very nobly, and give away
more provisions to coasters and guests who come to see
them than they expend amongst their own families.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The easy way of living in that plentiful country makes a
great many planters very negligent, which, were they otherwise,
that colony might now have been in a far better condition
than it is, as to trade and other advantages, which an
universal industry would have led them into. The women
are the most industrious sex in that place, and, by their good
housewifery, make a great deal of cloth of their own cotton,
wool and flax; some of them keeping their families,
though large, very decently appareled, both with linens and
woolens, so that they have no occasion to run into the merchants&rsquo;
debt, or lay their money out on stores for clothing.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As for those women that do not
expose themselves to the weather, they are often very fair,
and generally as well featured as you shall see anywhere,
and have very brisk, charming eyes which sets them off
to advantage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Both sexes are generally spare of body and not choleric,
nor easily cast down at disappointments and losses, seldom
immoderately grieving at misfortunes, unless for the loss of
their nearest relations and friends, which seems to make a
more than ordinary impression upon them. Many of the
women are very handy in canoes and will manage them
with great dexterity and skill, which they become accustomed
to in this watery country. They are ready to help
their husbands in any servile work, as planting, when the
season of the weather requires expedition; pride seldom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
banishing good housewifery. The girls are not bred up to
the wheel and sewing only, but the dairy and the affairs of
the house they are very well acquainted withal; so that you
shall see them, whilst very young, manage their business
with a great deal of conduct and alacrity. The children of
both sexes are very docile and learn any thing with a great
deal of care and method, and those that have the advantages
of education write very good hands, and prove good accountants,
which is most coveted, and, indeed, most necessary in
these parts. The young men are commonly of a bashful,
sober behaviour; few proving prodigals to consume what
the industry of their parents has left them, but commonly
improve it.</p>


<h3>HARVEST HOME OF THE INDIANS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From History of North Carolina.</i>)</p>

<p>They have a third sort of feasts and dances, which are
always when the harvest of corn is ended, and in the spring.
The one to return thanks to the good spirit for the fruits of
the earth; the other, to beg the same blessings for the succeeding
year. And to encourage the young men to labour
stoutly in planting their maiz and pulse, they set up a
sort of idol in the field, which is dressed up exactly like
an Indian, having all the Indians habit, besides abundance of
Wampum and their money, made of shells, that hangs about
his neck. The image none of the young men dare approach;
for the old ones will not suffer them to come near him, but tell
them that he is some famous Indian warrior that died a great
while ago, and now is come amongst them to see if they
work well, which if they do, he will go to the good spirit
and speak to him to send them plenty of corn, and to make
the young men all expert hunters and mighty warriors. All
this while, the king and old men sit around the image and
seemingly pay a profound respect to the same. One great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
help to these Indians in carrying on these cheats, and inducing
youth to do as they please, is, the uninterrupted silence
which is ever kept and observed with all the respect and
veneration imaginable.</p>

<p>At these feasts which are set out with all the magnificence
their fare allows of, the masquerades begin at night
and not before. There is commonly a fire made in the middle
of the house, which is the largest in the town, and is
very often the dwelling of their king or war captain; where
sit two men on the ground upon a mat; one with a rattle,
made of a gourd, with some beans in it; the other with a
drum made of an earthen pot, covered with a dressed deer
skin, and one stick in his hand to beat thereon; and so they
both begin the song appointed. At the same time one drums
and the other rattles, which is all the artificial music of their
own making I ever saw amongst them. To these two instruments
they sing, which carries no air with it, but is a
sort of unsavory jargon; yet their cadences and raising of
their voices are formed with that equality and exactness
that, to us Europeans, it seems admirable how they should
continue these songs without once missing to agree, each
with the others note and tune.</p>

<p>The following inscription on his tomb at Westover gives
a sketch of his life and services well worth preserving:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here lies the Honourable William Byrd, Esq., being born
to one of the amplest fortunes in this country, he was sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
early to England for his education, where under the care
and direction of Sir Robert Southwell, and ever favoured
with his particular instructions, he made a happy proficiency
in polite and various learning. By the means of the same
noble friend, he was introduced to the acquaintance of many
of the first persons of that age for knowledge, wit, virtue,
birth, or high station, and particularly contracted a most intimate
and bosom friendship with the learned and illustrious
Charles Boyle, Earl of Orrery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was called to the bar in the Middle Temple, studied
for some time in the Low Countries, visited the Court of
France, and was chosen Fellow of the Royal Society. Thus
eminently fitted for the service and ornament of his country,
he was made receiver-general of his Majesty&rsquo;s revenues here,
was then appointed public agent to the Court and Ministry
of England, being thirty-seven years a member, at last became
president, of the Council of this Colony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To all this were added a great elegancy of taste and

<h3>SELECTING THE SITE OF RICHMOND AND PETERSBURG,
SEPT., 1733.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From A Journey to the Land of Eden.</i>)</p>

<p>When we got home, we laid the foundations of two large
Citys. One at Shacco&rsquo;s, to be called Richmond, and the
other at the Point of Appamattuck River, to be nam&rsquo;d Petersburgh.
These Major Mayo offered to lay out into Lots
without Fee or Reward. The Truth of it is, these two
places being the uppermost Landing of James and Appamattux
Rivers, are naturally intended for Marts, where the
Traffick of the Outer Inhabitants must Center. Thus we
did not build Castles only, but also Citys in the Air.</p>


<h3>A VISIT TO EX-GOVERNOR SPOTSWOOD, 1732.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From A Progress to the Mines.</i>)</p>

<p>Then I came into the Main County Road, that leads from
Fredericksburgh to Germanna, which last place I reacht in
Ten Miles more. This famous Town consists of Colo.
Spotswood&rsquo;s enchanted Castle on one Side of the Street,
and a Baker&rsquo;s Dozen of ruinous Tenements on the other,
where so many German Familys had dwelt some Years ago;
but are now remov&rsquo;d ten Miles higher, in the Fork of Rappahannock,
to Land of their Own. There had also been a
Chappel about a Bow-Shot from the Colonel&rsquo;s house, at the
End of an Avenue of Cherry Trees, but some pious people
had lately burnt it down, with intent to get another built
nearer to their own homes.</p>

<p>Here I arriv&rsquo;d about three o clock, and found only Mrs.
Spotswood at Home, who receiv&rsquo;d her Old acquaintance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
with many a gracious Smile. I was carry&rsquo;d into a Room
elegantly set off with Pier Glasses, the largest of which
came soon after to an odd Misfortune. Amongst other
favourite Animals that cheer&rsquo;d this Lady&rsquo;s Solitude, a Brace
of Tame Deer ran familiarly about the House, and one of
them came to stare at me as a Stranger. But unluckily
Spying his own Figure in the Glass, he made a spring over
the Tea Table that stood under it, and shatter&rsquo;d the Glass to
pieces, and falling-back upon the Tea Table, made a terrible
Fracas among the China. This Exploit was so sudden,
and accompany&rsquo;d with such a Noise, that it surpriz&rsquo;d me,
and perfectly frighten&rsquo;d Mrs. Spotswood. But twas worth
all the Damage to shew the Moderation and good humour
with which she bore this disaster.</p>

<p>In the Evening, the noble Colo. came home from his Mines,
who saluted me very civilly, and Mrs. Spotswood&rsquo;s Sister,
Miss Theky, who had been to meet him <i>en Cavalier</i>, was
so kind too as to bid me welcome. We talkt over a Legend
of old Storys, supp&rsquo;d about 9, and then prattl&rsquo;d with the
Ladys, til twas time for a Travellour to retire. In the
mean time I observ&rsquo;d my old Friend to be very Uxorious,
and exceedingly fond of his Children. This was so opposite
to the Maxims he us&rsquo;d to preach up before he was marryed,
that I cou&rsquo;d not forbear rubbing up the Memory of
them. But he gave a very good-natur&rsquo;d turn to his Change
of Sentiments, by alleging that whoever brings a poor Gentlewoman
into so solitary a place, from all her Friends and
acquaintance, wou&rsquo;d be ungrateful not to use her and all
that belongs to her with all possible Tenderness.</p>

<p>We all kept Snug in our several apartments till Nine,
except Miss Theky, who was the Housewife of the Family.
At that hour we met over a Pot of Coffee, which was not
quite strong enough to give us the Palsy. After Breakfast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
the Colo. and I left the Ladys to their Domestick Affairs,
and took a turn in the Garden, which has nothing beautiful
but 3 Terrace Walks that fall in Slopes one below another.
I let him understand, that besides the pleasure of paying
him a Visit, I came to be instructed by so great a Master in
the Mystery of Making of Iron, wherein he had led the
way, and was the Tubal Cain of Virginia. He corrected
me a little there, by assuring me he was not only the first in
this Country, but the first in North America, who had
erected a regular Furnace.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That the 4 Furnaces
now at work in Virginia circulated a great Sum of Money
for Provisions and all other necessarys in the adjacent Countys.
That they took off a great Number of Hands from
Planting Tobacco, and employ&rsquo;d them in Works that produced
a large Sum of Money in England to the persons
concern&rsquo;d, whereby the Country is so much the Richer.
That they are besides a considerable advantage to Great
Britain, because it lessens the Quantity of Bar Iron imported
from Spain, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, and Muscovy,
which us&rsquo;d to be no less than 20,000 Tuns yearly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Then I inquired after his own Mines, and hoped, as he
was the first that engaged in this great undertaking, that he
had brought them to the most perfection.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He said
it was true His works were of the oldest Standing; but
that his long absence in England, and the wretched Management
of Mr. Greame, whom he had entrusted with his
Affairs, had put him back very much. That what with
Neglect and Severity, above 80 of his Slaves were lost while
he was in England, and most of his Cattle starved. That
his Furnace stood still great part of the time, and all his
Plantations ran to ruin. That indeed he was rightly serv&rsquo;d
for committing his Affairs to the care of a Mathematician,
whose thoughts were always among the Stars. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
nevertheless, since his return, he had apply&rsquo;d himself to rectify
his Steward&rsquo;s Mistakes, and bring his Business again into
Order. That now he contriv&rsquo;d to do every thing with his
own People, except raising the Mine and running the Iron,
by which he had contracted his Expence very much. Nay,
he believ&rsquo;d that by his directions he cou&rsquo;d bring sensible
Negroes to perform those parts of the work tolerably well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Our Conversation on this Subject continued till
Dinner, which was both elegant and plentifull.</p>

<p>The afternoon was devoted to the ladys, who shew&rsquo;d me
one of their most beautiful Walks. They conducted me
thro&rsquo; a Shady Lane to the Landing, and by the way made
me drink some very fine Water that issued from a Marble
Fountain, and ran incessantly. Just behind it was a cover&rsquo;d
Bench, where Miss Theky often sat and bewail&rsquo;d her Virginity.
Then we proceeded to the River, which is the South
Branch of Rappahannock, about 50 Yards wide, and so
rapid that the Ferry Boat is drawn over by a Chain, and
therefore called the Rapidan. At night we drank prosperity
to all the Colonel&rsquo;s Projects in a Bowl of Rack Punch,
and then retired to our Devotions.</p>

<h3>DISMAL SWAMP.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From The Dividing Line.</i>)</p>

<p><i>1728, March.</i>&mdash;Tis hardly credible how little the Bordering
inhabitants were acquainted with this mighty Swamp,
notwithstanding they had liv&rsquo;d their whole lives within Smell
of it. Yet, as great Strangers as they were to it, they pretended
to be very exact in their Account of its Demensions,
and were positive it could not be above 7 or 8 Miles wide,
but knew no more of the Matter than Star-gazers know of
the Distance of the Fixt Stars. At the Same time, they
were Simple enough to amuse our Men with Idle Stories of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
the Lyons, Panthers, and Alligators, they were like to encounter
in that dreadful Place.</p>

<p>In short, we saw plainly there was no Intelligence of this
Terra Incognita to be got, but from our own Experience.
For that Reason it was resolv&rsquo;d to make the requisite Disposition
to enter it next Morning. We alloted every one of
the Surveyors for this painful Enterprise, with 12 Men to
attend them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Besides this Luggage at their Backs, they were oblig&rsquo;d to
measure the distance, mark the Trees, and clear the way for
the Surveyors every step they went. It was really a Pleasure
to see with how much Cheerfulness they undertook, and
with how much Spirit they went thro&rsquo; all this
Drudgery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Altho&rsquo; there was no need of Example to inflame Persons
already so cheerful, yet to enter the People with the better
grace, the Author and two more of the Commissioners
accompanied them half a Mile into the Dismal. The Skirts
of it were thinly Planted with Dwarf Reeds and Gall-Bushes,
but when we got into the Dismal itself, we found
the Reeds grew there much taller and closer, and, to mend
the matter, was so interlac&rsquo;d with bamboe-briars, that there
was no scuffling thro&rsquo; them without the help of Pioneers.
At the same time, we found the Ground moist and trembling
under our feet like a Quagmire, insomuch that it was an
easy Matter to run a Ten-Foot-Pole up to the Head in it,
without exerting any uncommon Strength to do it.</p>

<p>Two of the Men, whose Burthens were the least cumbersome,
had orders to march before, with their Tomahawks,
and clear the way, in order to make an Opening for the
Surveyors. By their Assistance we made a Shift to push the
Line half a Mile in 3 Hours, and then reacht a small piece of
firm Land, about 100 Yards wide, Standing up above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
rest like an Island. Here the people were glad to lay down
their Loads and take a little refreshment, while the happy
man, whose lot it was to carry the Jugg of Rum, began
already, like &AElig;sop&rsquo;s Bread-Carriers, to find it grow a good
deal lighter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Since the Surveyors had enter&rsquo;d the Dismal, they had laid
Eyes on no living Creature: neither Bird nor Beast, Insect
nor Reptile came in View. Doubtless, the Eternal Shade
that broods over this mighty Bog, and hinders the sun-beams
from blessing the Ground, makes it an uncomfortable Habitation
for any thing that has life. Not so much as a Zealand
Frog cou&rsquo;d endure so Aguish a Situation.</p>

<p>It had one Beauty, however, that delighted the Eye, tho&rsquo;
at the Expense of all the other Senses; the Moisture of the
Soil preserves a continual Verdure, and makes every Plant an
Evergreen, but at the same time the foul Damps ascend without
ceasing, corrupt the Air, and render it unfit for Respiration.
Not even a Turkey-Buzzard will venture to fly over
it, no more than the Italian Vultures will over the filthy
Lake Avernus, or the Birds of the Holy Land over the
Salt Sea, where Sodom and Gomorrah formerly stood.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><i>How they Slept in the Dismal Swamp.</i>&mdash;They first cover&rsquo;d
the Ground with Square Pieces of Cypress bark, which
now, in the Spring, they cou&rsquo;d easily Slip off the Tree for
that purpose. On this they Spread their Bedding; but unhappily
the Weight and Warmth of their Bodies made the
Water rise up betwixt the Joints of the Bark, to their great
Inconvenience. Thus they lay not only moist, but also
exceedingly cold, because their Fires were continually going
out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>We could get no Tidings yet of our Brave Adventurers,
notwithstanding we despacht men to the likeliest Stations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
to enquire after them. They were still Scuffleing in the
Mire, and could not Possibly forward the Line this whole
day more than one Mile and 64 Chains. Every Step of this
Day&rsquo;s Work was thro&rsquo; a cedar Bog, where the Trees were
somewhat Smaller and grew more into a Thicket. It was
now a great Misfortune to the Men to find their Provisions
grow less as their Labour grew greater.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Tho&rsquo; this
was very severe upon English Stomachs, yet the People
were so far from being discomfited at it, that they still kept
up their good Humour, and merrily told a young Fellow in
the Company, who lookt very Plump and Wholesome, that
he must expect to go first to Pot, if matters shou&rsquo;d come to
Extremity.</p>

<p>This was only said by way of Jest, yet it made Him
thoughtful in earnest. However, for the present he return&rsquo;d
them a very civil answer, letting them know that, dead or
alive, he shou&rsquo;d be glad to be useful to such worthy good
friends. But, after all, this Humourous Saying had one
very good effect; for that younker, who before was a little
enclin&rsquo;d by his Constitution to be lazy, grew on a Sudden
Extreamly Industrious, that so there might be less Occasion
to carbonade him for the good of his Fellow-Travellers.</p>


<h3>THE TUSCARORA INDIANS AND THEIR LEGEND OF A CHRIST.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From History of the Dividing Line.</i>)</p>

<p><i>1729, November.</i>&mdash;By the Strength of our Beef, we made
a shift to walk about 12 Miles, crossing Blowing and Tewaw-homini
Creeks. And because this last Stream receiv&rsquo;d
its Appellation from the Disaster of a Tuscarora Indian, it
will not be Straggling much out of the way to say something
of that Particular Nation.</p>

<p>These Indians were heretofore very numerous and powerful,
making, within time of Memory, at least a Thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
Fighting Men. Their Habitation, before the War with
Carolina, was on the North Branch of Neuse River, commonly
call&rsquo;d Connecta Creek, in a pleasant and fruitful
Country. But now the few that are left of that Nation
live on the North Side of <span class="smcap">Moratuck</span>, which is all that
Part of Roanok below the great Falls, towards <span class="smcap">Albemarle</span>
Sound.</p>

<p>Formerly there were Seven Towns of these Savages, lying
not far from each other, but now their Number is greatly
reduc&rsquo;d.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>These Indians have a very odd Tradition amongst them,
that many years ago, their Nation was grown so dishonest,
that no man cou&rsquo;d keep any Goods, or so much as his loving
Wife to himself. That, however, their God, being unwilling
to root them out for their crimes, did them the honour to
send a Messenger from Heaven to instruct them, and set
Them a perfect Example of Integrity and kind Behaviour
towards one another.</p>

<p>But this holy Person, with all his Eloquence and Sanctity
of Life, was able to make very little Reformation amongst
them. Some few Old men did listen a little to his Wholesome
Advice, but all the Young fellows were quite incorrigible.
They not only Neglected his Precepts, but derided
and Evil Entreated his Person. At last, taking upon Him
to reprove some Young Rakes of the Conechta Clan very
sharply for their impiety, they were so provok&rsquo;d at the Freedom
of his Rebukes, that they tied him to a Tree, and shot
him with Arrows through the Heart. But their God took
instant Vengeance on all who had a hand in that Monstrous
Act, by Lightning from Heaven, &amp; has ever since visited their
Nation with a continued Train of Calamities, nor will he ever
leave off punishing, and wasting their People, till he shall
have blotted every living Soul of them out of the World.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">HENRY LAURENS.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1724=1792.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Henry Laurens</span>, one of the patriot-fathers of our country,
was born in Charleston, South Carolina. He was educated
in his native city, and, becoming a merchant, amassed
a fortune in business. In 1771 he travelled with his children
in Europe in order to educate them. Returning home
he became in 1775 a member of the Provincial Congress,
and on Hancock&rsquo;s resignation, president of the Continental
Congress. He was appointed in 1779 minister to Holland,
and on his way was captured by the British and confined
in the Tower fifteen months. He became acquainted with
Edmund Burke while in London. He was twice offered
pardon if he would serve the British Ministry, but of course
he declined. During this imprisonment, his son John, called
the &ldquo;Bayard of the Revolution&rdquo; for his daring bravery, was
killed in battle.</p>

<p>After his release, being exchanged for Lord Cornwallis,
he was appointed one of the ministers to negotiate peace in
1782. His health was so impaired by the cruel treatment
of his jailers, that he could take no further active part in
affairs, and he passed the rest of his life in the retirement of
his plantation. On his death, his body was burned, according
to his express will, the first instance, in this country, of
cremation.</p>

<h3>A PATRIOT IN THE TOWER.</h3>

<p class="caption">Tower of London.</p>

<p>About 11 o&rsquo;clock at night I was sent under a strong
guard, up three pair of stairs in Scotland Yard, into a very
small chamber. Two king&rsquo;s messengers were placed for
the whole night at one door, and a subaltern&rsquo;s guard of soldiers
at the other. As I was, and had been for some days,
so ill as to be incapable of getting into or out of a carriage,
or up or down stairs, without help, I looked upon all this
parade to be calculated for intimidation. My spirits were
good and I smiled inwardly. The next morning, 6th October,
from Scotland Yard, I was conducted again under
guard to the secretary&rsquo;s office, White Hall.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
was first asked, by Lord Stormont, &ldquo;If my name was Henry
Laurens.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly, my Lord, that is my name.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
His Lordship then said, &ldquo;Mr. Laurens, we have a
paper here&rdquo; (holding the paper up), &ldquo;purporting to be a
commission from Congress to you, to borrow money in Europe
for the use of Congress.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I replied,
&ldquo;My Lords, your Lordships are in possession of the paper,
and will make such use of it as your Lordships shall judge
proper.&rdquo; I had not destroyed this paper, as it would serve
to establish the rank and character in which I was employed
by the United States.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From
White Hall, I was conducted in a close hackney coach, under
the charge of Colonel Williamson, a polite, genteel officer,
and two of the illest-looking fellows I had ever seen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
The coach was ordered to proceed by the most private ways
to the Tower. It had been rumored that a rescue would be
attempted. At the Tower the Colonel delivered me to
Major Gore, the residing Governor, who, as I was afterwards
well informed, had previously concerted a plan for
mortifying me. He ordered rooms for me in the most conspicuous
part of the Tower (the parade). The people of
the house, particularly the mistress, entreated the Governor
not to burthen them with a prisoner. He replied, &ldquo;It is
necessary. I am determined to expose him.&rdquo; This was,
however, a lucky determination for me. The people were
respectful and kindly attentive to me, from the beginning of
my confinement to the end; and I contrived, after being
told of the Governor&rsquo;s humane declaration, so to garnish
my windows by honeysuckles, and a grape-vine running
under them, as to conceal myself entirely from the sight of
starers, and at the same time to have myself a full view of
them. Governor Gore conducted me to my apartments at
a warder&rsquo;s house. As I was entering the house, I heard
some of the people say, &ldquo;Poor old gentleman, bowed down
with infirmities. He is come to lay his bones here.&rdquo; My
reflection was, &ldquo;I shall not leave a bone with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was very sick, but my spirits were good, and my mind
foreboding good from the event of being a prisoner in London.
Their Lordships&rsquo; orders were: &ldquo;To confine me a
close prisoner; to be locked up every night; to be in the
custody of two wardens, who were not to suffer me to be
out of their sight <em>one moment</em>, day or night; to allow me
no liberty of speaking to any person, nor to permit any
person to speak to me; to deprive me of the use of pen and
ink; to suffer no letter to be brought to me, nor any to go
from me,&rdquo; etc. As an apology, I presume for their first
rigor, the wardens gave me their orders to peruse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
And now I found myself a close prisoner, indeed; shut
up in two small rooms, which together made about twenty
feet square; a warder my constant companion; and a fixed
bayonet under my window; not a friend to converse with,
and no prospect of a correspondence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><i>September 23d.</i>&mdash;For some time past I have been frequently
and strongly tempted to make my escape from the
Tower, assured, &ldquo;It was the advice and desire of all my
friends, the thing might be easily effected, the face of American
affairs was extremely gloomy. That I might have eighteen
hours&rsquo; start before I was missed; time enough to reach
Margate and Ostend; that it was believed there would be no
pursuit,&rdquo; etc., etc. I had always said, &ldquo;I hate the name of
a runaway.&rdquo; At length I put a stop to farther applications
by saying, &ldquo;I will not attempt an escape. The gates were
opened for me to enter; they shall be opened for me to go
out of the Tower. God Almighty sent me here for some
purpose. I am determined to see the end of it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>GEORGE WASHINGTON.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1732=1799.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">George Washington&rsquo;s</span> life is so well known, it is so simple,
so grand, that a few words can tell it, and yet volumes
would not exhaust it. His mother&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;George was
always a good son,&rdquo; sums up his character; and his title,
&ldquo;Father of his Country,&rdquo; sums up his life-work.</p>

<p class="caption">George Washington.</p>

<p>He was born at Pope&rsquo;s Creek, Westmoreland County, Virginia,
and became a surveyor, being employed in that capacity
at the early age of sixteen by Lord Fairfax, governor of
Virginia. He joined the English troops sent under General
Braddock against the French in 1756, and his bravery and
good sense in this expedition gained him great renown. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
1775 he was made commander-in-chief of the American
forces against the English and he conducted the war of the
Revolution to a successful issue in 1783. He was the first
president of the United States, being elected in 1789, and
again in 1793, declining a third term in 1797. He retired
to private life at Mt. Vernon, his home in Virginia. Here
he died, and here he lies buried, his tomb being a shrine of
pilgrimage for all his countrymen and admirers.</p>

<p>Innumerable monuments rise all over our land commemorating
his virtues and pointing him out as a model for the
youth of America. One of the finest is that at Richmond, designed
by Crawford, an equestrian statue in bronze, surrounded
by colossal figures of Jefferson, Mason, Patrick
Henry, Lewis, Marshall, and Nelson. The marble statue
by Houdon in the Capitol at Richmond is considered the
best figure of Washington; it was done from life in 1788.
Other noble memorials are the Column at Baltimore, and
the great obelisk at Washington City, called the Washington
Monument, the latter designed by Robert Mills, of South
Carolina, and intended originally to have a colonnade
around the base containing the statues of the illustrious men
of our country.</p>

<h3>ON HIS APPOINTMENT AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>Delivered in Congress, 16 June, 1775.</i>]</p>

<p>Mr. President: Though I am truly sensible of the high
honor done me, in this appointment, yet I feel great distress,
from a consciousness that my abilities and military experience
may not be equal to the extensive and important trust.
However, as the Congress desire it, I will enter upon the
momentous duty, and exert every power I possess in their
service, and for the support of the glorious cause. I beg
they will accept my most cordial thanks for this distinguished
testimony of their approbation.</p>

<p>But, lest some unlucky event should happen, unfavorable
to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered by every
gentleman in the room, that I, this day, declare with the
utmost sincerity, I do not think myself equal to the command
I am honored with.</p>

<p>As to pay, Sir, I beg leave to assure the Congress, that,
as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept
this arduous employment, at the expense of my domestic
ease and happiness, I do not wish to make any profit
from it. I will keep an exact account of my expenses.
Those, I doubt not, they will discharge, and that is all I
desire.</p>

<h3>A MILITARY DINNER-PARTY.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>Letter to Dr. John Cochran, West Point, 16 August, 1779.</i>]</p>

<p>Dear Doctor: I have asked Mrs. Cochran and Mrs. Livingston
to dine with me to-morrow; but am I not in honor
bound to apprise them of their fare? As I hate deception,
even where the imagination only is concerned, I will. It
is needless to premise, that my table is large enough to hold
the ladies. Of this they had ocular proof yesterday. To
say how it is usually covered, is rather more essential; and
this shall be the purport of my letter.</p>

<p>Since our arrival at this happy spot, we have had a ham,
sometimes a shoulder of bacon, to grace the head of the
table; a piece of roast beef adorns the foot; and a dish of
beans, or greens, almost imperceptible, decorates the centre.
When the cook has a mind to cut a figure, which I presume
will be the case to-morrow, we have two beef-steak pies, or
dishes of crabs, in addition, one on each side of the centre
dish, dividing the space and reducing the distance between
dish and dish to about six feet, which without them would
be near twelve feet apart. Of late he has had the surprising
sagacity to discover, that apples will make pies; and it is a
question, if, in the violence of his efforts, we do not get one
of apples, instead of having both of beef-steaks. If the
ladies can put up with such entertainment, and will submit
to partake of it on plates, once tin but now iron (not become
so by the labor of scouring), I shall be happy to see them;
and am, dear Doctor, yours, etc.</p>


<h3>ADVICE TO A FAVORITE NEPHEW.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>From a Letter to Bushrod Washington.&mdash;Newburgh, 15 Jan., 1783.</i>]</p>

<p>Remember, that it is not the mere study of the law, but
to become eminent in the profession of it, that is to yield
honor and profit. The first was your choice; let the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
be your ambition. Dissipation is incompatible with both;
the company, in which you will improve most, will be least
expensive to you; and yet I am not such a stoic as to suppose
that you will, or to think it right that you should,
always be in company with senators and philosophers; but
of the juvenile kind let me advise you to be choice. It is
easy to make acquaintances, but very difficult to shake them
off, however irksome and unprofitable they are found, after
we have once committed ourselves to them. The indiscretions,
which very often they involuntarily lead one into,
prove equally distressing and disgraceful.</p>

<p>Be courteous to all, but intimate with few; and let those
few be well tried before you give them your confidence.
True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo
and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled
to the appellation.</p>

<p>Let your heart feel for the distresses and afflictions of
every one, and let your hand give in proportion to your
purse; remembering always the estimation of the widow&rsquo;s
mite, but, that it is not every one who asketh, that deserveth
charity; all, however, are worthy of the inquiry, or the
deserving may suffer.</p>

<p>Do not conceive that fine clothes make fine men, any more
than fine feathers make fine birds. A plain, genteel dress
is more admired, and obtains more credit, than lace and embroidery,
in the eyes of the judicious and sensible.</p>


<h3>PASSAGES FROM THE FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE
OF THE UNITED STATES, 1796.</h3>

<p><i>Union and Liberty.</i>&mdash;Interwoven as is the love of liberty
with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of
mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
The unity of government which constitutes you one people,
is also now dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main
pillar in the edifice of your real independence; the support
of your tranquillity at home; your peace abroad; of your
safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty which you
so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee, that from different
causes, and from different quarters, much pains will
be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds
the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political
fortress against which the batteries of internal and
external enemies will be most constantly and actively
(though often covertly and insidiously) directed; it is of
infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense
value of your national union to your collective and
individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial,
habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming
yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of
your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation
with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever
may suggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be
abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning
of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country
from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link
together the various parts.</p>

<p>For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest.
Citizens by birth, or choice, of a common country,
that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The
name of American, which belongs to you in your national
capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism, more
than any appellation derived from local discriminations.
With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion,
manners, habits, and political principles. You have, in a
common cause, fought and triumphed together; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
independence and liberty you possess, are the work of joint
counsels, and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings,
and successes.</p>

<p>But these considerations, however powerfully they address
themselves to your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by
those which apply more immediately to your interest. Here,
every portion of our country finds the most commanding
motives for carefully guarding and preserving the union
of the whole.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. While then every part of our country thus feels
an immediate and particular interest in union, all the parts
combined cannot fail to find in the united mass of means
and efforts, greater strength, greater resource, proportionably
greater security from external danger, a less frequent
interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is
of inestimable value, they must derive from union an exemption
from those broils and wars between themselves,
which so frequently afflict neighbouring countries not tied
together by the same government; which their own rivalships
alone would be sufficient to produce, but which opposite
foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues, would stimulate
and imbitter. Hence, likewise, they will avoid the
necessity of those overgrown military establishments, which
under any form of government are inauspicious to liberty, and
which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican
liberty. In this sense it is, that your union ought to be considered
as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of
the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the
other.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><i>Party Spirit.</i>&mdash;I have already intimated to you the danger
of parties in the State, with particular references to the
founding them on geographical discriminations. Let me
now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
most solemn manner, against the baleful effects of the spirit
of party generally.</p>

<p>This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature,
having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind.
It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or
less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but in those of the popular
form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly
their worst enemy.</p>

<p>The alternate domination of one faction over another,
sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissensions,
which in different ages and countries has perpetrated
the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism.
But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent
despotism. The disorders and miseries which result, gradually
incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in
the absolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later,
the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate
than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes
of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.</p>

<p>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind
(which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight),
the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party,
are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise
people to discourage and restrain it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful
checks upon the administration of the government, and
serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This, within certain
limits, is probably true; and, in governments of a monarchical
cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, if not
with favour, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the
popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a
spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency,
it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
every salutary purpose. And there being constant danger
of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion,
to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it
demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a
flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.</p>

<p><i>Religion and Morality.</i>&mdash;Of all the dispositions and habits
which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality
are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim
the tribute of patriotism, who should labour to subvert these
great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the
duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally
with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A
volume could not trace all their connections with private
and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, where is the
security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of
religious obligation <em>desert</em> the oaths which are the instruments
of investigation in courts of justice?</p>

<p>And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality
can be maintained without religion. Whatever may
be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds
of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us
to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclusion of
religious principle.</p>

<p>It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary
spring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends
with more or less force to every species of free government.
Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with
indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the
fabrick?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate
peace and harmony with all. Religion and morality
enjoin this conduct; and can it be that good policy does not
equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
and, at no distant period, a great nation, to give to mankind
the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always
guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can
doubt but, in the course of time and things, the fruits of
such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages
which might be lost by a steady adherence to it; can it be
that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of
a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at least, is recommended
by every sentiment which ennobles human nature.</p>

<h2>PATRICK HENRY.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1736=1799.</b></p>


<p>This great orator was born at Studley, Hanover County,
Virginia; and, while his early education in books was not
extensive, he studied man and nature from life very deeply
and thoroughly. He attempted farming and merchandising
for some years, then read law and at the age of twenty-four
was admitted to the bar where his splendid powers had full
scope. In 1765 he was elected to the State Legislature, or
House of Burgesses, as it was then called.</p>

<p>In the words of Thomas Jefferson, &ldquo;Mr. Henry certainly
gave the first impulse to the ball of the Revolution.&rdquo; During
the war, he served at first in the field, and later in the
Legislature, and as governor, being elected three times.
He retired from public life in 1791 and devoted himself to
his law practice, by which he gained wealth.</p>

<h3>THE FAMOUS REVOLUTION SPEECH, 1775.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Wirt&rsquo;s Life of Henry.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. President,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is natural to man to indulge
in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes
against a painful truth&mdash;and listen to the song of that siren,
till she transforms us into beasts. Is this,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;the
part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle
for liberty? Were we disposed to be of the number of
those, who having eyes see not, and having ears hear not,
the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?
For his part, whatever anguish of spirit it might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
cost, <em>he</em> was willing to know the whole truth; to know the
worst, and provide for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but one lamp by which his feet were
guided; and that was the lamp of experience. He knew of
no way of judging of the future but by the past. And
judging by the past, he wished to know what there had
been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten
years, to justify those hopes with which gentlemen had
been pleased to solace themselves and the house? Is it that
insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?
Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your
feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss.
Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition
comports with those warlike preparations which cover our
waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary
to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown
ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that force must be
called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves,
sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation,&mdash;the
last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen,
sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be
not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any
other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy
in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation
of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They
are meant for us; they can be meant for no other. They
are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which
the British ministry have been so long forging. And what
have we [to] oppose to them? Shall we try argument?
Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have
we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We
have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable;
but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find,
which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech
you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done
everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is
now coming on. We have petitioned&mdash;we have remonstrated&mdash;we
have supplicated&mdash;we have prostrated ourselves
before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest
the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament.
Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have
produced additional violence and insult; our supplications
have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with
contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these
things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation.
<em>There is no longer any room for hope.</em> If we
wish to be free&mdash;if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable
privileges for which we have been so long contending&mdash;if
we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle
in which we have been so long engaged, and which we
have pledged ourselves never to abandon, until the glorious
object of our contest shall be obtained&mdash;we must fight!&mdash;I
repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to
the God of hosts, is all that is left us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They tell us, sir,&rdquo; continued Mr. Henry, &ldquo;that we are
weak&mdash;unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But
when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week or the
next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed and
when a British guard shall be stationed in every house?
Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction?
Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying
supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of
hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?
Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of those means
which the God of nature hath placed in our power. Three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in
such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by
any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides,
sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God
who presides over the destinies of nations and who will raise
up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not
to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the
brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base
enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.
There is no retreat but in submission and slavery!
Our chains are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the
plains of Boston! The war is inevitable&mdash;and let it come!!
I repeat it, sir, let it come!!!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen
may cry, peace, peace,&mdash;but there is no peace. The war is
actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north
will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our
brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle?
What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have?
Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the
price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God&mdash;I
know not what course others may take; but as for me,&rdquo;
cried he, with both his arms extended aloft, his brows knit,
every feature marked with the resolute purpose of his soul,
and his voice swelled to its boldest note of exclamation,&mdash;&ldquo;give
me liberty, or give me death!&rdquo; See also under <i>Wirt</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Henry Drayton</span> was born at &ldquo;Drayton
Hall,&rdquo; on the Ashley River, South Carolina, and was sent
in 1753 to England to be educated. He went in the care of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
Chief-Justice Charles Pinckney, who was taking his two
sons, Charles Cotesworth and Thomas, for the same purpose.
He returned home in 1764, studied law, and in 1771
was appointed by the king privy-councillor for South Carolina.
He espoused, however, the cause of the Revolution,
with ardor, and was chosen president of the Council of
Safety and of the Provincial Congress. As Chief-Justice of
the State, he declared that the king &ldquo;had abdicated the government
and had no more authority over the people of South
Carolina.&rdquo; He also dealt with the Indians and exercised a
wholesome influence over them in behalf of the State.</p>

<p>He left in manuscript valuable state papers and a narrative
of the early part of the Revolution, which his son,
Governor John Drayton, edited and published, and from
which the extract is taken. His style is clear, simple, and
flowing.</p>


<h3>GEORGE III.&rsquo;s ABDICATION OF POWER IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>From the Charge to the Grand Jury of Charleston District, 1776.</i>]</p>

<p>Thus, as I have on the foot of the best authorities made
it evident, that George III. King of Britain, has endeavoured
to subvert the constitution of this country, by breaking the
original contract between king and people; by the advice
of wicked persons has violated the fundamental laws; and
has withdrawn himself by withdrawing the constitutional
benefits of the kingly office, and his protection out of this
country; from such a result of injuries, from such a conjuncture
of circumstances&mdash;the law of the land authorizes me to
declare, and it is my duty boldly to declare the law, that
George III. King of Britain, has abdicated the government,
and that the throne is thereby vacant; that is, <em>he has no
authority over us, and we owe no obedience to him</em>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The new constitution is wisely adapted to enable us to trade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
with foreign nations, and thereby, to supply our wants in
the <em>cheapest</em> markets in the universe; to extend our trade
infinitely beyond what it has ever been known; to encourage
manufactures among us; and it is peculiarly formed, to
promote the happiness of the people, from among whom,
by virtue and merit, <em>the poorest</em> man may arrive at <em>the
highest dignity</em>.&mdash;Oh, Carolinians! happy would you be
under this new constitution, if you knew your happy state.</p>

<p>Possessed of a constitution of government, founded upon
so generous, equal, and natural a principle,&mdash;a government
expressly calculated to make the people rich, powerful, virtuous,
and happy, who can wish to change it, to return under
a Royal government; the vital principles of which, are the
reverse in every particular! It was my duty to lay this
happy constitution before you, in its genuine light&mdash;it is
your duty to understand&mdash;to instruct others&mdash;and to defend
it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I think it my duty to declare in the awful seat of justice
and before Almighty God, that in my opinion, the Americans
can have no safety but by the Divine Favour, their own
virtue, and their being so prudent, as <em>not to leave it in the
power of the British rulers to injure them</em>. Indeed the
ruinous and deadly injuries received on our side; and the
jealousies entertained, and which, in the nature of things,
must daily increase against us on the other; demonstrate to
a mind, in the least given to reflection upon the rise and fall
of empires, that true reconcilement never can exist between
Great Britain and America, the latter being in subjection to
the former.</p>

<p>The Almighty created America to be independent of
Britain; let us beware of the impiety of being backward to
act as instruments in the Almighty Hand, now extended to
accomplish his purpose; and by the completion of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
alone, America, in the nature of human affairs, can be secure
against the craft and insidious designs of <em>her enemies who
think her prosperity and power already by far too great</em>. In
a word, our piety and political safety are so blended, that
to refuse our labours in this divine work, is to refuse to be
a great, a free, a pious, and a happy people!</p>

<p>And now having left the important alternative, political
happiness or wretchedness, under God, in a great degree in
your own hands; I pray the supreme Arbiter of the affairs
of men, so to direct your judgment, as that you may act
agreeable to what seems to be his will, revealed in his
miraculous works in behalf of America, bleeding at the
altar of liberty!</p>

<h2>THOMAS JEFFERSON.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1743=1826.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Jefferson</span>, the &ldquo;Sage of Monticello,&rdquo; and
founder of the University of Virginia, was born at Shadwell,
Albemarle County, Virginia. He was educated at
William and Mary College, and early developed a rare taste
for study, music, and general culture. His is one of the
greatest and most interesting figures in our history. He received
and adorned all the positions in the gift of his fellow-citizens,
from that of member of the State Legislature to
that of President of the United States, which office he twice
filled. He is considered the founder of the present Democratic
party in politics; and he gained imperishable fame
as the author of the Declaration of Independence. He spent
five years in France, succeeding Benjamin Franklin as minister
to that country, and he introduced into the United
States the decimal system of currency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
His love for country life induced him to retire to Monticello,
his place in Albemarle County, where he spent his
declining years in planning and establishing the University
of Virginia. His love of freedom in every possible form
is shown in his plan for the University, which was, unlike
most colleges of the times, to be under the patronage of no
church, and the students were to be controlled like any community
of citizens. He was also opposed to slavery. (<i>See
his Notes on Virginia.</i>)</p>

<p>He died at Monticello, July 4, 1826, on the same day
with John Adams, just fifty years after the great event of
their lives, the declaration of independence of the United
States.</p>

<p>The following inscription was at his own request put

<h3>RELIGIOUS OPINIONS AT THE AGE OF TWENTY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From a letter to John Page.</i>)</p>

<p>Perfect happiness, I believe, was never intended by the
Deity to be the lot of one of his creatures in this world;
but that he has very much put in our power the nearness
of our approaches to it, is what I have steadfastly believed.
The most fortunate of us, in our journey through life, frequently
meet with calamities and misfortunes, which may
greatly afflict us; and, to fortify our minds against the
attacks of these calamities and misfortunes, should be one
of the principal studies and endeavors of our lives. The
only method of doing this is to assume a perfect resignation
to the Divine will, to consider whatever does happen must
happen; and that by our uneasiness, we cannot prevent the
blow before it does fall, but we may add to its force after it
has fallen. These considerations, and others such as these,
may enable us in some measure to surmount the difficulties
thrown in our way; to bear up with a tolerable degree of
patience under this burthen of life; and to proceed with a
pious and unshaken resignation, till we arrive at our journey&rsquo;s
end, when we may deliver up our trust into the hands
of him who gave it, and receive such reward as to him shall
seem proportioned to our merit. Such, dear Page, will be
the language of the man who considers his situation in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
life, and such should be the language of every man who
would wish to render that situation as easy as the nature of
it will admit. Few things will disturb him at all; nothing
will disturb him much.</p>


<h3>SCENERY AT HARPER&rsquo;S FERRY AND AT THE NATURAL
BRIDGE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Notes on Virginia, written in 1781, published in 1801.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.</p>

<p>The passage of the Patowmac through the Blue Ridge is
perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in nature. You
stand on a very high point of land. On your right comes
up the Shenandoah, having ranged along the foot of the
mountain an hundred miles to seek a vent. On your left
approaches the Patowmac, in quest of a passage also. In
the moment of their junction they rush together against the
mountain, rend it asunder, and pass off to the sea. The
first glance of this scene hurries our senses into the opinion,
that this earth has been created in time, that the mountains
were formed first, that the rivers began to flow afterwards,
that in this place particularly they have been damned up by
the Blue ridge of mountains, and have formed an ocean
which filled the whole valley; that continuing to rise they
have at length broken over at this spot, and have torn the
mountain down from its summit to its base. The piles of
rock on each hand, but particularly on the Shenandoah, the
evident marks of their disrupture and avulsion from their
beds by the most powerful agents of nature, corroborate
the impression. But the distant finishing which nature
has given to the picture, is of a very different character.
It is a true contrast to the foreground. It is as placid
and delightful, as that is wild and tremendous. For the
mountain being cloven asunder, she presents to your eye,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
through the cleft, a small catch of smoothe blue horizon,
at an infinite distance in the plain country, inviting you,
as it were, from the riot and tumult roaring around, to pass
through the breach and participate of the calm
below.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The Natural Bridge, the most sublime of nature&rsquo;s works,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
is on the ascent of a hill, which seems
to have been cloven through its length by some great convulsion.
The fissure, just at the bridge, is, by some admeasurements,
270 feet deep, by others only 205. It is about 45
feet wide at the bottom, and 90 feet at the top; this of
course determines the length of the bridge, and its height
from the water. Its breadth in the middle, is about 60 feet,
but more at the ends, and the thickness of the mass, at the
summit of the arch, about 40 feet. A part of this thickness
is constituted by a coat of earth, which gives growth to
many large trees. The residue, with the hill on both sides,
is one solid rock of lime-stone.</p>

<p>The arch approaches the semi-elliptical form; but the
larger axis of the ellipsis, which would be the cord of the
arch, is many times longer than the transverse. Though
the sides of this bridge are provided in some parts with a
parapet of fixed rocks, yet few men have the resolution to
walk to them, and look over into the abyss. You involuntarily
fall on your hands and feet, creep to the parapet, and
peep over it. Looking down from this height about a minute,
gave me a violent head-ach.</p>

<p>If the view from the top be painful and intolerable, that
from below is delightful in an equal extreme. It is impossible
for the emotions arising from the sublime, to be felt
beyond what they are here: so beautiful an arch, so elevated,
so light, and springing as it were up to heaven! the
rapture of the spectator is really indescribable! The fissure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
continuing narrow, deep, and straight, for a considerable
distance above and below the bridge, opens a short but very
pleasing view of the North mountain on one side, and Blue
ridge on the other, at the distance each of them of about
five miles. This bridge is in the county of Rockbridge, to
which it has given name, and affords a public and commodious
passage over a valley, which cannot be crossed elsewhere
for a considerable distance. The stream passing
under it is called Cedar-creek.</p>


<h3>ON FREEDOM OF RELIGIOUS OPINION.</h3>

<p>Compulsion makes hypocrites, not converts.</p>

<p>It is error alone that needs the support of government:
truth can stand by itself.</p>


<h3>ON THE DISCOURSES OF CHRIST.</h3>

<p>Such are the fragments remaining to us to show a master-workman,
and that his system of morality was the most
benevolent and sublime that has ever been taught, and consequently
more perfect than those of any of the ancient
philosophy.</p>


<h3>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From an Act Passed in the Assembly of Virginia, 1786.</i>)</p>

<p>Well aware that Almighty God hath created the mind
free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments
or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits
of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the
plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who being Lord
both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by
coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do;
that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil
as well as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible
and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking
as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavouring
to impose them on others, hath established and maintained
false religions over the greatest part of the world, and
through all time; that to compel a man to furnish contributions
of money for the propagation of opinions which he
disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into
the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation
of principles, on the supposition of their ill tendency,
is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty,
because he being of course judge of that tendency, will
make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn
the sentiments of others only as they shall square with
or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful
purposes of civil government, for its officers to interfere
when principles break out into overt acts against peace and
good order; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail
if left to herself, that she is the proper and sufficient
antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the
conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of her
natural weapons, free argument and debate, errors ceasing
to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict
them:</p>

<p><em>Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly</em>, That no
man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious
worship, place or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced,
restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor
shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions
or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by
argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion
and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect
their civil capacities.</p>

<h3>LETTER TO HIS DAUGHTER, MARTHA JEFFERSON.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Written in France, May 21, 1787.</i>)</p>

<p>I write you, my dear Patsy, from the canal of Languedoc,
on which I am at present sailing, as I have been for a week
past,&mdash;cloudless skies above, limpid waters below, and on
each hand, a row of nightingales in full chorus. This delightful
bird had given me a rich treat before, at the fountain
of Vaucluse. After visiting the tomb of Laura, at Avignon,
I went to see this fountain&mdash;a noble one of itself, and
rendered forever famous by the songs of Petrarch, who lived
near it. I arrived there somewhat fatigued, and sat down
by the fountain to repose myself. It gushes, of the size of
a river, from a secluded valley of the mountain, the ruins of
Petrarch&rsquo;s ch&acirc;teau being perched on a rock two hundred feet
perpendicular above. To add to the enchantment of the
scene, every tree and bush was filled with nightingales in
full song. I think you told me that you had not yet noticed
this bird. As you have trees in the garden of the Convent
[<i>in Paris, where Martha was at school</i>], there might be
nightingales in them, and this is the season of their song.
Endeavor, my dear, to make yourself acquainted with the
music of this bird, that when you return to your own country
you may be able to estimate its merit in comparison
with that of the mocking-bird. The latter has the advantage
of singing through a great part of the year, whereas the
nightingale sings but about five or six weeks in the spring,
and a still shorter term, and with a more feeble voice, in the
fall.</p>

<p>I expect to be in Paris about the middle of next month.
By that time we may begin to expect our dear Polly [<i>the
younger daughter, Maria</i>] It will be a circumstance of inexpressible
comfort to me to have you both with me once
more. The object most interesting to me for the residue of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
my life, will be to see you both developing daily those principles
of virtue and goodness which will make you valuable
to others and happy in yourselves, and acquiring those talents
and that degree of science which will guard you at all
times against <i>ennui</i>, the most dangerous poison of life. A
mind always employed is always happy. This is the true
secret, the grand recipe, for felicity. The idle are the only
wretched. In a world which furnishes so many employments
which are useful, and so many which are amusing, it
is our own fault if we ever know what <i>ennui</i> is, or if we
are ever driven to the miserable resource of gaming, which
corrupts our dispositions, and teaches us a habit of hostility
against all mankind.</p>

<p>We are now entering the port of Toulouse, where I quit
my bark, and of course must conclude my letter. Be good
and be industrious, and you will be what I shall most love
in the world. Adieu, my dear child.</p>

<h3>JEFFERSON&rsquo;S LAST LETTER, IN ANSWER TO AN INVITATION
TO BE PRESENT AT THE CELEBRATION OF THE FIFTIETH
ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE, IN WASHINGTON.&mdash;TO
MR. WEIGHTMAN, MAYOR OF WASHINGTON.</h3>

<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Monticello</span>, <i>June 24, 1826</i>.</p>

<p><i>Respected Sir:</i> The kind invitation received from you, on
the part of the citizens of the city of Washington, to be present
with them at their celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of
American Independence, as one of the surviving signers of
an instrument pregnant with our own, and the fate of the
world, is most flattering to myself, and heightened by the
honorable accompaniment proposed for the comfort of such a
journey. It adds sensibly to the sufferings of sickness, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
be deprived by it of a personal participation in the rejoicing
of that day. But acquiescence is a duty, under circumstances
not placed among those we are permitted to control.
I should, indeed, with peculiar delight, have met and exchanged
there congratulations personally with the small
band, the remnant of that host of worthies, who joined with
us on that day, in the bold and doubtful election we were
to make for our country, between submission or the sword;
and to have enjoyed with them the consolatory fact, that our
fellow-citizens, after half a century of experience and prosperity,
continue to approve the choice we made. May it be
to the world, what I believe it will be (to some parts sooner,
to others later, but finally to all), the signal of arousing men
to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition
had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to
assume the blessings and security of self-government. That
form which we have substituted, restores the free right to
the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion.
All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. The
general spread of the light of science has already laid open
to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind
has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored
few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by
the grace of God. These are grounds of hope for others.
For ourselves, let the annual return of this day, forever refresh
our recollections of these rights, and an undiminished
devotion to them.</p>

<p>I will ask permission here to express the pleasure with
which I should have met my ancient neighbors of the city
of Washington and its vicinities, with whom I passed so
many years of a pleasing social intercourse; an intercourse
which so much relieved the anxieties of the public cares,
and left impressions so deeply engraved in my affections as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
never to be forgotten. With my regret that ill health forbids
me the gratification of an acceptance, be pleased to receive
for yourself, and those for whom you write, the assurance
of my highest respect and friendly attachments.</p>

<h2>DAVID RAMSAY.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1749=1815.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">David Ramsay</span> was a native of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,
was educated at Princeton, studied medicine at the
University of Pennsylvania, and removed to Charleston, S.&nbsp;C.,
for the practice of his profession. He soon acquired
celebrity both as a physician and as a patriot in the Revolutionary
struggles. He was a member of the Council of
Safety and a surgeon in the army. He was one of the forty
prominent citizens who were sent as hostages to St. Augustine
at the capture of Charleston in 1780 and kept for eleven
months in close confinement. His death was caused by
wounds received from a maniac, who shot him in the street
for testifying as to his mental unsoundness.</p>

<p>His second wife was Martha Laurens, daughter of Henry
Laurens, who had spent ten years in Europe and who was
always active in intellectual and benevolent pursuits. She
assisted her husband in his writing and prepared her sons for
college. Two of their daughters long had an excellent and
celebrated school for girls in Charleston.</p>

<h3>BRITISH TREATY WITH THE CHEROKEES, 1755.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From History of South Carolina.</i>)</p>

<p>In the course of eighty years, or about the middle of the
eighteenth century, the most valuable lands in the low country
were taken up: and settlements were gradually progressing
westwardly on favorite spots in the middle and
upper country. The extinction of Indian claims by a cession
of territory to the king, was necessary to the safety of
the advancing settlers. This was obtained in 1755. In that
year, Governor Glen met the Cherokee warriors in their own
country, and held a treaty with them. After the usual ceremonies
were ended, the governor made a speech to the assembled
warriors in the name of his king; representing his
great power, wealth, and goodness, and his particular regard
for his children, the Cherokees. He reminded them
of the happiness they had long enjoyed by living under his
protection, and added, that he had many presents to make
them and expected they would surrender a share of their
territories in return. He informed them of the wicked designs
of the French, and hoped they would permit none of
them to enter their towns. He demanded lands to build
two forts in their country, to protect them against their enemies,
and to be a retreat to their friends and allies, who
furnished them with arms, ammunition, hatchets, clothes,
and everything that they wanted.</p>

<p>When the governor had finished his speech, Chulochcullak
arose, and in answer spoke to the following effect:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I now speak, our father the great king should
hear. We are brothers to the people of Carolina, one house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
covers us all.&rdquo; Then taking a boy by the hand, he presented
him to the governor, saying, &ldquo;We, our wives, and
our children, are all children of the great king George; I
have brought this child, that when he grows up he may remember
our agreement on this day, and tell it to the next
generation, that it may be known forever.&rdquo; Then opening
his bag of earth, and laying the same at the governor&rsquo;s feet,
he said: &ldquo;We freely surrender a part of our lands to the
great king. The French want our possessions, but we will
defend them while one of our nation shall remain alive.&rdquo;
Then delivering the governor a string of wampum, in confirmation
of what he said, he added: &ldquo;My speech is at an
end&mdash;it is the voice of the Cherokee nation. I hope the
governor will send it to the king, that it may be kept forever.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>SERGEANT JASPER AT FORT MOULTRIE, <i>28th June, 1776</i>.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the History of South Carolina.</i>)</p>

<p>The loss of the garrison was ten men killed and twenty-two
wounded. Lieutenants Hall and Gray were among the
latter. Though there were many thousand shots fired from
the shipping, yet the works were little damaged: those
which struck the fort were ineffectually buried in its soft
wood. Hardly a hut or tree on the island escaped.</p>

<p>When the British appeared off the coast, there was so
scanty a stock of lead, that to supply the musketry with
bullets, it became necessary to strip the windows of the
dwelling-houses in Charleston of their weights. Powder
was also very scarce. The proportion allotted for the defence
of the fort was but barely sufficient for slow firing.
This was expended with great deliberation. The officers in
their turn pointed the guns with such exactness that most
of their shot took effect. In the beginning of the action,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
the flag-staff was shot away. Sergeant Jasper of the Grenadiers
immediately jumped on the beach, took up the flag
and fastened it on a sponge-staff. With it in his hand he
mounted the merlon; and, though the ships were directing
their incessant broadsides at the spot, he deliberately fixed
it. The day after the action, President Rutledge presented
him with a sword, as a mark of respect for his distinguished
valor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>On the third day after the action, the lady of Colonel
Bernard Elliott presented an elegant pair of colors to the
second regiment, which had so bravely defended Fort Moultrie.
Her address on the occasion concluded thus: &ldquo;I make
not the least doubt, under heaven&rsquo;s protection, you will
stand by these colors as long as they wave in the air of
liberty.&rdquo; In reply a promise was made that &ldquo;they should
be honorably supported, and never should be tarnished, by
the second regiment.&rdquo; This engagement was literally fulfilled.
Three years after they were planted on the British
lines at Savannah: one by Lieutenant Bush who was immediately
shot down; Lieutenant Hume in the act of
planting his was also shot down; and Lieutenant Gray in
supporting them received a mortal wound. The brave Sergeant
Jasper on seeing Lieutenant Hume fall, took up
the color and planted it. In doing so, he received a wound
which terminated in death; but on the retreat being ordered
he brought the colors off with him. These were taken
at the fall of Charleston and are said to be now in the tower
of London.</p>


<h3>SUMPTER AND MARION.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the Same.</i>)</p>

<p>As the British advanced to the upper country of South
Carolina, a considerable number of the determined friends of
independence retreated before them and took refuge in North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
Carolina. In this class was Colonel Sumpter; a gentleman
who had formerly commanded one of the continental regiments,
and who was known to possess a great share of
bravery and other military talents. In a very little time
after he had forsaken his home, a detachment of the British
turned his wife and family out of doors, burned the house
and everything that was in it. A party of these exiles from
South Carolina who had convened in North Carolina made
choice of Colonel Sumpter to be their leader. At the head
of this little band of freemen he soon returned to his own
State, and took the field against the victorious British. He
made this gallant effort at a time when the inhabitants had
generally abandoned the idea of supporting their own independence,
and when he had every difficulty to encounter.
The State was no longer in a condition to pay, clothe, or
feed the troops who had enrolled themselves under his command.
His followers were, in a great measure, unfurnished
with arms and ammunition; and they had no magazines
from which they might draw a supply. The iron tools, on
the neighboring farms, were worked up for their use by
common blacksmiths into rude weapons of war. They
supplied themselves, in part, with bullets by melting the
pewter which they were furnished by private housekeepers.
They sometimes came to battle when they had not three
rounds a man; and some were obliged to keep at a distance,
till, by the fall of others, they were supplied with arms.
When they proved victorious they were obliged to rifle the
dead and wounded of their arms and ammunition to equip
them for their next engagement.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>General Francis Marion was born at Winyaw in 1733.
His grandfather was a native of Languedoc, and one of
the many Protestants who fled from France to Carolina to
avoid persecution on the account of religion. He left thirteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
children, the eldest of whom was the father of the
general. Francis Marion, when only sixteen years of age,
made choice of a sea-faring life. On his first voyage to the
West Indies he was shipwrecked. The crew, consisting of
six persons, took to the open boat without water or
provisions;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they were six
days in the boat before they made land. Two of the crew
perished. Francis Marion with three others reached land.
This disaster, and the entreaties of his mother, induced him
to quit the sea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>On the approach of General Gates he advanced with a
small party through the country towards the Santee. On
his arrival there he found a number of his countrymen ready
and willing to put themselves under his command, to which
he had been appointed by General Gates. This corps afterwards
acquired the name of Marion&rsquo;s brigade.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
In all these marches Marion and his men lay in the open air
with little covering, and with little other food than sweet
potatoes and meat mostly without salt. Though it was the
unhealthy season of autumn, yet sickness seldom occurred.
The general fared worse than his men; for his baggage
having caught fire by accident, he had literally but half a
blanket to cover him from the dews of the night, and but
half a hat to shelter him from the rays of the sun.</p>

<h2>JAMES MADISON.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1751=1836.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">James Madison</span>, fourth president of the United States,
was born at Port Conway, Virginia, and was a graduate of
Princeton, where he was a profound and excellent student.
He and Jefferson were always friends; yet they differed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
in some political opinions, for Madison was a Federalist,
and he contributed many papers to the periodical of that
name.</p>

<p>In 1794 he married Mrs. Dorothy Payne Todd, a lady of
extraordinary beauty and rare accomplishments; and the
reign of Mrs. Dolly Madison at the White House is esteemed
its most brilliant period. &ldquo;Memoirs and Letters of Dolly
Madison,&rdquo; by her grand-niece, published in 1887 at Boston,
is a most interesting book.</p>

<p>President Madison died at his home &ldquo;Montpelier,&rdquo; Orange
County, Virginia. See his Life, by W.&nbsp;C. Rives, and by
Gay.</p>

</p>

<p>Professor Fiske says of Madison: &ldquo;Among the founders
of our nation, his place is beside that of Washington, Jefferson,
and Marshall; but his part was peculiar. He was
pre-eminently the scholar, the profound constructive thinker,
and his limitations were such as belong to that character.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>OPINION OF LAFAYETTE, (IN LETTERS TO JEFFERSON).</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Rives&rsquo; Life of Madison.</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>)</p>

<p>(<i>17 Oct., 1784.</i>)&mdash;The time I have lately passed with the
Marquis has given me a pretty thorough insight into his
character. With great natural frankness of temper, he
unites much address and very considerable talents. In his
politics, he says his three hobby-horses are the alliance between
France and the United States, the union of the latter,
and the manumission of the slaves. The two former are
the dearer to him, as they are connected with his personal
glory.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
(<i>20 August, 1785.</i>)&mdash;Subsequent to the date of mine in
which I gave my idea of Lafayette, I had other opportunities
of penetrating his character. Though his foibles did
not disappear, all the favorable traits presented themselves
in a stronger light, on closer inspection. He certainly possesses
talents which might figure in any line. If he is ambitious,
it is rather of the praise which virtue dedicates to
merit than of the homage which fear renders to power.
His disposition is naturally warm and affectionate, and his
attachment to the United States unquestionable. Unless I
am grossly deceived, you will find his zeal sincere and useful,
whenever it can be employed on behalf of the United
States without opposition to the essential interests of
France.</p>


<h3>PLEA FOR A REPUBLIC, ALTHOUGH A NEW FORM
OF GOVERNMENT.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the &ldquo;Federalist,&rdquo; 14th No.</i>)</p>

<p>But why is the experiment of an extended Republic to be
rejected, merely because it may comprise what is new? Is
it not the glory of the people of America, that, whilst they
have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times
and other nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration
for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule the suggestions
of their own good sense, the knowledge of their
own situation, and the lessons of their own experience? To
this manly spirit posterity will be indebted for the possession,
and the world for the example, of the numerous improvements
displayed on the American theatre in favor
of private rights and public happiness. Had no important
step been taken by the leaders of the Revolution
for which a precedent could not be discovered; no government
established of which an exact model did not present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
itself,&mdash;the people of the United States might, at this moment,
have been numbered among the melancholy victims
of misguided counsels; must, at best, have been laboring
under the weight of some of those forms which have
crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind. Happily for
America,&mdash;happily, we trust, for the whole human race,
they pursued a new and more noble course. They accomplished
a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of
human society. They reared the fabrics of government,
which have no model on the face of the globe. They
formed the design of a great Confederacy, which it is incumbent
on their successors to improve and perpetuate. If
their works betray imperfections, we wonder at the fewness
of them. If they erred most in the structure of the Union,
this was the work most difficult to be executed; this is the
work which has been new-modelled by the act of your
convention; and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate
and decide.</p>


<h3>CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON.</h3>

<p class="center">(&ldquo;<i>drawn by Mr. Madison, amid the tranquil scenes of his own final retirement; and
intended&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for his family and friends.</i>&rdquo;)</p>

<p>The strength of his character lay in his integrity, his love
of justice, his fortitude, the soundness of his judgment, and
his remarkable prudence; to which he joined an elevated
sense of patriotic duty, and a reliance on the enlightened
and impartial world as the tribunal by which a lasting sentence
on his career would be pronounced. Nor was he
without the advantage of a stature and figure which, however
insignificant when separated from greatness of character,
do not fail, when combined with it, to aid the attraction.
What particularly distinguished him was a modest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
dignity, which at once commanded the highest respect and
inspired the purest attachment.</p>

<p>Although not idolizing public opinion, no man could be
more attentive to the means of ascertaining it. In comparing
the candidates for office, he was particularly inquisitive
as to their standing with the public, and the opinion
entertained of them by men of public weight. On the important
questions to be decided by him, he spared no pains
to gain information from all quarters; freely asking from
all whom he held in esteem, and who were intimate with
him, a free communication of their sentiments; receiving
with great attention the arguments and opinions offered to
him; and making up his own judgment with all the leisure
that was permitted.</p>

<h2>JOHN MARSHALL.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1755=1835.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">John Marshall</span>, third Chief Justice of the United
States, was born in Fauquier County, Virginia. He served
as a soldier in the Revolution and then practised law
in Richmond. With Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and
Elbridge Gerry, he was sent to Paris in 1797 to treat of
public affairs; and it was on this occasion that Pinckney
made the famous reply to the propositions of Talleyrand,
&ldquo;Millions for defence, not a cent for tribute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was chief-justice of the United States for thirty-five
years, being appointed in 1800 and holding the position until
his death. One of the most celebrated cases over which
he presided was the trial of Aaron Burr, 1807, in which
William Wirt led the prosecution, and Luther Martin and
Burr himself, the defence. His services on the Supreme
Bench were not only judicial but patriotic also, as his decisions
on points of constitutional law, being broad, clear,
strong, and statesman-like, have done much to settle the
foundations of our government.</p>

<p>He died in Philadelphia whither he had gone for medical
treatment. A handsome statue of him by Story adorns the
west grounds of the Capitol at Washington, and his is one
of the six colossal bronze figures around the Washington
Monument in Richmond. See Life, by Story, and by Magruder.</p>

<h3>POWER OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Case of Cohen vs. State of Virginia, given in Magruder&rsquo;s Life of Marshall.</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>)</p>

<p>It is authorized to decide all cases of every description
arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States.
From this general grant of jurisdiction no exception is made
of those cases in which a State may be a party. When we
consider the situation of the government of the Union and
of a State in relation to each other, the nature of our Constitution,
the subordination of the State governments to
that Constitution, the great purpose for which jurisdiction
over all cases arising under the Constitution and
laws of the United States is confided to the judicial department,
are we at liberty to insert in this general grant an
exception of those cases in which a State may be a party?
Will the spirit of the Constitution justify this attempt to
control its words? We think it will not. We think a case
arising under the Constitution or laws, of the United States
is cognizable in the courts of the Union, whoever may be
the parties to that case. The laws must be executed by individuals
acting within the several States. If these individuals
may be exposed to penalties, and if the courts of the
Union cannot correct the judgments by which these penalties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
may be enforced, the course of government may be at
any time arrested by the will of one of its members. Each
member will possess a <em>veto</em> on the will of the whole.</p>

<p>That the United States form, for many and most important
purposes, a single nation has not yet been denied.
These States are constituent parts of the United States.
They are members of one great empire, for some purposes
sovereign, for some purposes subordinate. In a government
so constituted is it unreasonable that the judicial power
should be competent to give efficacy to the constitutional
laws of the legislature? That department can decide on the
validity of the Constitution or law of a State, if it be repugnant
to the Constitution or to a law of the United
States. Is it unreasonable that it should also be empowered
to decide on the judgment of a State tribunal enforcing such
unconstitutional law? Is it so very unreasonable as to
furnish a justification for controlling the words of the Constitution?
We think not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>


<h3>THE DUTIES OF A JUDGE.</h3>

<p>Advert, sir, to the duties of a judge. He has to pass
between the government and the man whom that government
is prosecuting; between the most powerful individual
in the community and the poorest and most unpopular. It
is of the last importance that, in the exercise of these duties
he should observe the utmost fairness. Need I press the
necessity of this? Does not every man feel that his own
personal security and the security of his property depends
on that fairness? The judicial department comes home, in
its effects, to every man&rsquo;s fireside; it passes on his property,
his reputation, his life, his all. Is it not to the last degree
important that he should be rendered perfectly and completely
independent, with nothing to influence or control
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
him, but God and his conscience?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have
always thought, from my earliest youth until now, that the
greatest scourge an angry Heaven ever inflicted upon an
ungrateful and sinning people was an ignorant, a corrupt,
or a dependent judiciary. Our ancestors thought so; we
thought so until very lately; and I trust that the vote of
this day will show that we think so still. Will you draw
down this curse on Virginia?</p>

<h2>HENRY LEE.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1756=1818.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Henry Lee</span>, &ldquo;Light-Horse Harry,&rdquo; of the Revolution,
and father of General R.&nbsp;E. Lee, was born at Leesylvania,
Westmoreland County, Virginia. His father was also named
Henry Lee, and his mother was Lucy Grymes, the famous
&ldquo;lowland beauty,&rdquo; who first captured Washington&rsquo;s heart.
Her son was a favorite of his, and it is an interesting fact that
it was this same Henry Lee who delivered by request of Congress
the funeral oration on Washington. In it he used
those now well-known words, &ldquo;First in war, first in peace,
first in the hearts of his countrymen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was educated at Princeton, and joined the American
army in 1777, with his company, as Captain Lee. He rose
successively to be major, colonel, general; and after the
war he served in the Continental Congress and in the Virginia
Legislature. He was injured in a riot at Baltimore,
while trying to defend a friend, and went to Cuba for his
health; but he died on his way home, at Cumberland Island
on the coast of Georgia, at the home of General Greene&rsquo;s
daughter, Mrs. Shaw.</p>

<p>With his first wife, his cousin Matilda Lee, he obtained
Stratford House, where R.&nbsp;E. Lee was born; whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
mother however, was the second wife, Anne Hill Carter of
Shirley.</p>

<h3>CAPTURE OF FORT MOTTE BY LEE AND MARION,
MAY, 1780.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From General Henry Lee&rsquo;s Memoirs of the War.</i>)</p>

<p>This post was the principal depot of the convoys from
Charleston to Camden, and sometimes for those destined for
Fort Granby and Ninety-Six. A large new mansion house,
belonging to Mrs. Motte, situated on a high and commanding
hill, had been selected for this establishment. It was
surrounded with a deep trench, along the interior margin of
which was raised a strong and lofty parapet. To this post
had been regularly assigned an adequate garrison of about
one hundred and fifty men, which was now accidentally increased
by a small detachment of dragoons, which had arrived
from Charleston a few hours before the appearance of
the American troops, on its way to Camden with despatches
for Lord Rawdon. Captain M&rsquo;Pherson commanded, an officer
highly and deservedly respected.</p>

<p>Opposite to Fort Motte, to the north, stood another hill,
where Mrs. Motte, having been dismissed from her mansion,
resided, in the old farmhouse. On this height Lieutenant-Colonel
Lee with his corps took post, while Brigadier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
Marion occupied the eastern declivity of the ridge on which
the fort stood.</p>

<p>The vale which runs between the two hills admitted our
safe approach within four hundred yards of the fort. This
place was selected by Lee to break ground. Relays of working
parties being provided for every four hours, and some of
the negroes from the neighbouring plantations being brought,
by the influence of Marion, to our assistance, the works advanced
with rapidity. Such was their forwardness on the
10th, that it was determined to summon the commandant.</p>

<p>A flag was accordingly despatched to Captain M&rsquo;Pherson,
stating to him with truth our relative situation, and admonishing
him to avoid the disagreeable consequences of an arrogant
temerity. To this the captain replied, that, disregarding
consequences, he should continue to resist to the last
moment. The retreat of Rawdon was known in the evening
to the besiegers; and in the course of the night a courier
arrived from General Greene confirming that event, urging
redoubled activity, and communicating his determination
to hasten to their support. Urged by these strong considerations,
Marion and Lee persevered throughout the night
in pressing the completion of their works. On the next day,
Rawdon reached the country opposite to Fort Motte; and
in the succeeding night encamping on the highest ground in
his route, the illumination of his fires gave the joyful annunciation
of his approach to the despairing garrison. But
the hour was close at hand, when this joy was to be converted
into sadness.</p>

<p>The large mansion in the centre of the encircling trench,
left but a few yards of the ground within the enemy&rsquo;s works
uncovered; burning the house must force their surrender.</p>

<p>Persuaded that our ditch would be within arrow shot before
noon of the next day, Marion and Lee determined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
adopt this speedy mode of effecting their object. Orders
were instantly issued to prepare bows and arrows, with missive
combustible matter. This measure was reluctantly
adopted; for the destruction of private property was repugnant
to the principles which swayed the two commandants,
and upon this occasion was peculiarly distressing. The devoted
house was a large, pleasant edifice, intended for the
summer residence of the respectable owner, whose deceased
husband had been a firm patriot, and whose only marriageable
daughter was the wife of Major Pinckney, an officer in
the South Carolina line, who had fought and bled in his
country&rsquo;s cause, and was now a prisoner with the enemy.
These considerations powerfully forbade the execution of
the proposed measure; but there were others of much cogency,
which applied personally to Lieutenant Colonel Lee,
and gave a new edge to the bitterness of the scene.</p>

<p>Encamping contiguous to Mrs. Motte&rsquo;s dwelling, this officer
had, upon his arrival, been requested in the most pressing
terms to make her house his quarters. The invitation
was accordingly accepted; and not only the lieutenant colonel,
but every officer of his corps, off duty, daily experienced
her liberal hospitality, politely proffered and as politely
administered. Nor was the attention of this amiable
lady confined to that class of war which never fail to attract
attention. While her richly spread table presented
with taste and fashion all the luxuries of her opulent country,
and her sideboard offered without reserve the best wines
of Europe&mdash;antiquated relics of happier days&mdash;her active
benevolence found its way to the sick and to the wounded;
cherishing with softest kindness infirmity and misfortune,
converting despair into hope, and nursing debility into
strength. Nevertheless the obligations of duty were imperative;
the house must burn; and a respectful communication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
to the lady of her destined loss must be made. Taking
the first opportunity which offered, the next morning,
Lieutenant Colonel Lee imparted to Mrs. Motte the intended
measure; lamenting the sad necessity, and assuring her of
the deep regret which the unavoidable act excited in his
and every breast.</p>

<p>With a smile of complacency this exemplary lady listened
to the embarrassed officer, and gave instant relief to his agitated
feelings, by declaring, that she was gratified with the
opportunity of contributing to the good of her country, and
that she should view the approaching scene with delight.
Shortly after, seeing accidentally the bows and arrows which
had been prepared, she sent for the lieutenant colonel, and
presenting him with a bow and its apparatus imported from
India, she requested his substitution of these, as probably
better adapted for the object than those we had provided.</p>

<p>Receiving with silent delight this opportune present, the
lieutenant colonel rejoined his troops, now making ready for
the concluding scene. The lines were manned, and an additional
force stationed at the battery, lest the enemy, perceiving
his fate, might determine to risk a desperate assault,
as offering the only chance of relief. As soon as the troops
reached their several points, a flag was again sent to M&rsquo;Pherson,
for the purpose of inducing him to prevent the conflagration
and the slaughter which might ensue, by a second
representation of his actual condition.</p>

<p>Doctor Irvine, of the legion cavalry, was charged with
the flag, and instructed to communicate faithfully the inevitable
destruction impending, and the impracticability of relief,
as Lord Rawdon had not yet passed the Santee; with
an assurance that longer perseverance in vain resistance,
would place the garrison at the mercy of the conqueror;
who was not regardless of the policy of preventing waste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
of time by inflicting exemplary punishment, where resistance
was maintained only to produce such waste. The
British captain received the flag with his usual politeness,
and heard patiently Irvine&rsquo;s explanations; but he remained
immovable; repeating his determination of holding out to
the last.</p>

<p>It was now about noon, and the rays of the scorching sun
had prepared the shingle roof for the projected conflagration.
The return of Irvine was immediately followed by
the application of the bow and arrows. The first arrow
struck and communicated its fire; a second was shot at
another quarter of the roof, and a third at a third quarter;
this last also took effect, and, like the first, soon kindled a
blaze. M&rsquo;Pherson ordered a party to repair to the loft of the
house, and by knocking off the shingles to stop the flames.
This was soon perceived, and Captain Finley was directed
to open his battery, raking the loft from end to end.</p>

<p>The fire of our six pounder, posted close to one of the
gable ends of the house, soon drove the soldiers down; and
no other effort to stop the flames being practicable, M&rsquo;Pherson
hung out the white flag.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Powerfully as the present occasion called for punishment,
and rightfully as it might have been inflicted, not a drop of
blood was shed, nor any part of the enemy&rsquo;s baggage taken.
M&rsquo;Pherson and his officers accompanied their captors to
Mrs. Motte&rsquo;s, and partook with them of a sumptuous dinner;
soothing in the sweets of social intercourse the ire
which the preceding conflict had engendered.</p>


<h3>THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the funeral oration, 1800.</i>)</p>

<p>First in war&mdash;first in peace&mdash;and first in the hearts of
his countrymen, he was second to none in the humble and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
endearing scenes of private life; pious, just, humane, temperate,
and sincere; uniform, dignified, and commanding,
his example was as edifying to all around him, as were
the effects of that example lasting.</p>

<p>To his equals he was condescending, to his inferiors
kind, and to the dear objects of his affections exemplarily
tender; correct throughout, vice shuddered in his presence,
and virtue always felt his fostering hand; the purity
of his private character gave effulgence to his public
virtues.</p>

<p>His last scene comported with the whole tenor of his
life&mdash;although in extreme pain, not a sigh, not a groan
escaped him; and with undisturbed serenity, he closed his
well-spent life. Such was the man America has lost&mdash;such
was the man for whom our nation mourns.</p>

<p>Methinks I see his august image, and I hear falling from
his venerable lips these deep-sinking words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cease, sons of America, lamenting our separation: go
on, and confirm by your wisdom the fruits of our joint councils,
joint efforts, and common dangers; reverence religion,
diffuse knowledge throughout your land, patronize the arts
and sciences; let Liberty and Order be inseparable companions.
Control party spirit, the bane of free governments;
observe good faith to, and cultivate peace with all
nations, shut up every avenue to foreign influence, contract
rather than extend national connection, rely on yourselves
only; be Americans in thought, word and deed;&mdash;thus will
you give immortality to that union which was the constant
object of my terrestrial labors; thus will you preserve undisturbed
to the latest posterity the felicity of a people to me
most dear, and thus will you supply (if my happiness is
now aught to you) the only vacancy in the round of pure
bliss high Heaven bestows.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE HATCHET STORY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Life of Washington.</i>)</p>

<p>The following anecdote is a case in point; it is too valuable
to be lost, and too true to be doubted, for it was communicated
to me by the same excellent lady to whom I was
indebted for the last, [a relative of the Washington family.]</p>

<p>&ldquo;When George,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was about six years old, he
was made the wealthy master of a <em>hatchet</em>! of which, like
most little boys, he was immoderately fond, and was constantly
going about chopping everything that came in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
way. One day, in the garden, where he often amused himself
hacking his mother&rsquo;s pea-sticks, he unluckily tried the
edge of his hatchet on the body of a beautiful young English
cherry-tree, which he barked so terribly that I don&rsquo;t believe
the tree ever got the better of it. The next morning the
old gentleman finding out what had befallen his tree, which,
by the by, was a great favorite, came into the house, and
with much warmth asked for the mischievous author, declaring
at the same time that he would not have taken five
guineas for his tree. Nobody could tell him anything about
it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance.
&lsquo;George,&rsquo; said his father, &lsquo;do you know who killed
that beautiful little cherry-tree yonder in the garden?&rsquo; This
was a <em>tough question</em>, and George staggered under it for a
moment; but quickly recovered himself; and looking at
his father, with the sweet face of youth brightened with the
inexpressible charm of all-conquering truth, he bravely cried
out, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell a lie, Pa; you know I can&rsquo;t tell a lie; I did
cut it with my hatchet.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Run to my arms, you dearest
boy,&rsquo; cried his father in transports, &lsquo;run to my arms. Glad
am I, George, that you ever killed my tree, for you have
paid me for it a thousand-fold. Such an act of heroism in
my son, is more worth than a thousand trees, though blossomed
with silver, and their fruits of purest gold.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3>A REVOLUTIONARY OBJECT LESSON IN THE CAUSE OF PATRIOTISM,
APRIL 1775.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Memoirs of the Revolution.</i>)</p>

<p>With all these occurrences, men&rsquo;s minds had become agitated;
and it was deemed proper to bring forth something
calculated to arrest the public attention, to throw odium on
the British Administration, to put down the Crown officers
in the Province, and to invigorate the ardor of the people.
And nothing was deemed more likely to effect the same
than some public exhibition which might speak to the sight
and senses of the multitude.</p>

<p>For this purpose effigies were brought forward, supposed
to be by the authority or connivance of the Secret Committee.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
They represented the Pope,
Lord Grenville, Lord North, and the Devil. They were
placed on the top of a frame capable of containing one or two
persons within it; and the frame was covered over with
thick canvas, so that those within could not be distinguished.
In the front of the frame on the top, the Pope was seated in
a chair of state, in his pontifical dress; and at a distance
immediately behind him the Devil was placed in a standing
position, holding a barbed dart in his right hand; between
the Pope and the Devil, on each side, Lords Grenville and
North were stationed. Thus finished the frame and effigies
were fixed on four wheels; and early in the morning, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
uncommon spectacle was stationed between the Market and St.
Michael&rsquo;s Church in Broad-street to the gaze of the citizens.</p>

<p>Many were the surmises respecting it; but at length by
its evolutions, it soon began to explain the purposes for which
it was constructed. For no sooner did any of the Crown officers,
Placemen, Counsellors, or persons known to be disaffected
to the common cause, pass by than the Pope immediately
bowed with proportioned respect to them, and the Devil at
the same moment striking his dart at the head of the Pope
convulsed the populace with bursts of laughter. While on the
other hand, the immovable effigies of Lords Grenville and
North, appearing like attendants on the Pope or criminals,
moved the people with sentiments of disgust and contempt
against them and the whole British Administration, for the
many oppressive acts which they had been instrumental in
procuring to be passed through both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>In this manner the machine was exposed; after which it
was paraded through the town the whole day by the mob;
and in the evening, they carried it beyond the town where
surrounding it with tar barrels the whole was committed to
the flames. Nor did the idea or influence of the thing end
here&mdash;for boys forsook their customary sports to make
models like it, with which having amused themselves, and
having roused their youthful spirits into a detestation of
oppression, they also committed them to the flames. And
many of those very boys supported with their services and
blood the rights and liberties of their country.</p>


<h3>THE BATTLE OF NOEWEE, BETWEEN THE SOUTH
CAROLINIANS AND THE CHEROKEES, 1776.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Memoirs of the Revolution in South Carolina.</i>)</p>

<p>The army now crossed Cannucca Creek, and was proceeding
towards Noewee Creek when tracks of the enemy&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
spies were discovered about half past ten o&rsquo;clock, <small>A.&nbsp;M.</small>, and
the army was halted and thrown into close order. It then
proceeded on its left towards a narrow valley, bordering on
Noewee Creek, and enclosed on each side by lofty mountains,
terminated at the extremity by others equally difficult;
and commenced entering the same, for the purpose of crossing
the Appalachean Ridge, which separated the Middle
Settlements from those in the Vallies.</p>

<p>These heights were occupied by twelve hundred Indian
Warriors; nor were they discovered, until the advance guard
of one hundred men began to mount the height, which terminated
the valley. The army having thus completely
fallen into the ambuscade of the enemy, they poured in a
heavy fire upon its front and flanks; compelling it to recoil,
and fall into confusion. Great was the perturbation which
then prevailed, the cry being, &ldquo;<em>We shall be cut off</em>;&rdquo; and
while Col. Williamson&rsquo;s attention was imperiously called to
rally his men, and charge the enemy, he was at the same
time obliged to reinforce the baggage guard, on which the
subsistence of the army depended for provisions, in this
mountainous wilderness.</p>

<p>In this extremity, Lieutenant-Colonel Hammond caused
detachments to file off, for the purpose of gaining the eminences
above the Indians, and turning their flanks; while
Lieutenant Hampton with twenty men, advanced upon the
enemy, passing the main advance guard of one hundred
men: who, being panic-struck, were rapidly retreating.
Hampton, however, clambered up the ascent, with a manly
presence of mind; which much encouraged all his followers:
calling out, &ldquo;<em>Loaded guns advance&mdash;empty guns, fall
down and load:</em>&rdquo; and being joined by thirty men, he charged
desperately on the foe. The Indians now gave way; and
a panic passing among them from right to left, the troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
rallied and pressed them with such energy, as induced a
general flight: and the army was thereby rescued from a
total defeat and massacre.</p>

<p>Besides this good fortune, they became possessed of so
many packs of deer skins and baggage; that they sold
among the individuals of the army, for &pound;1,200 currency;
and which sum was equally distributed among the troops.
In this engagement, the killed of Williamson&rsquo;s army, were
thirteen men, and one Catawba Indian; and the wounded
were, thirty-two men, and two Catawbas. Of the enemy,
only four were found dead, and their loss would have been
more considerable, if many of them had not been mistaken
for the friendly Catawbas, who were in front.</p>

<h3>THE BLIND PREACHER, (JAMES WADDELL<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>).</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From The British Spy.</i>)</p>

<p>It was one Sunday, as I travelled through the county of
Orange, [Virginia], that my eye was caught by a cluster of
horses tied near a ruinous, old, wooden house in the forest,
not far from the roadside. Having frequently seen such
objects before, in travelling through those States, I had no
difficulty in understanding that this was a place of religious
worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
Devotion alone should have stopped me, to join in the duties
of the congregation; but I must confess that curiosity
to hear the preacher of such a wilderness, was not the least
of my motives. On entering, I was struck with his preternatural
appearance. He was a tall and very spare old man;
his head which was covered with a white linen cap, his
shrivelled hands, and his voice, were all shaking under the
influence of a palsy; and a few moments ascertained to me
that he was perfectly blind.</p>

<p>The first emotions that touched my breast were those of
mingled pity and veneration. But how soon were all my
feelings changed! The lips of Plato were never more
worthy of a prognostic swarm of bees, than were the lips of
this holy man! It was a day of the administration of the sacrament;
and his subject was, of course, the passion of our
Saviour. I have heard the subject handled a thousand times;
I had thought it exhausted long ago. Little did I suppose
that in the wild woods of America, I was to meet with a
man whose eloquence would give to this topic a new and
more sublime pathos than I had ever before witnessed.</p>

<p>As he descended from the pulpit to distribute the mystic
symbols, there was a peculiar, a more than human solemnity
in his air and manner, which made my blood run cold, and
my whole frame shiver.</p>

<p>He then drew a picture of the sufferings of our Saviour;
his trial before Pilate; his ascent up Calvary; his crucifixion;
and his death. I knew the whole history; but never
until then had I heard the circumstances so selected, so arranged,
so colored! It was all new; and I seemed to have
heard it for the first time in my life. His enunciation was
so deliberate that his voice trembled on every syllable; and
every heart in the assembly trembled in unison. His peculiar
phrases had the force of description, that the original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
scene appeared to be at that moment acting before our eyes.
We saw the very faces of the Jews; the staring, frightful
distortions of malice and rage. We saw the buffet; my
soul kindled with a flame of indignation; and my hands
were involuntarily and convulsively clinched.</p>

<p>But when he came to touch on the patience, the forgiving
meekness of our Saviour; when he drew, to the life, his
blessed eyes streaming in tears to heaven; his voice breathing
to God a soft and gentle prayer of pardon on his enemies,
&ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do,&rdquo;&mdash;the voice of the preacher, which had all along faltered,
grew fainter and fainter, until, his utterance being
entirely obstructed by the force of his feelings, he raised his
handkerchief to his eyes, and burst into a loud and irrepressible
flood of grief. The effect is inconceivable. The
whole house resounded with the mingled groans, and sobs,
and shrieks of the congregation.</p>

<p>It was some time before the tumult had subsided, so far as
to permit him to proceed. Indeed, judging by the usual,
but fallacious standard of my own weakness, I began to be
very uneasy for the situation of the preacher. For I could
not conceive how he would be able to let his audience down
from the height to which he had wound them, without impairing
the solemnity and dignity of his subject, or perhaps
shocking them by the abruptness of the fall. But&mdash;no: the
descent was as beautiful and sublime as the elevation had
been rapid and enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The first sentence, with which he broke the awful silence,
was a quotation from Rousseau: &ldquo;Socrates died like a philosopher,
but Jesus Christ, like a God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I despair of giving you any idea of the effect produced
by this short sentence, unless you could perfectly conceive
the whole manner of the man, as well as the peculiar crisis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
in the discourse. Never before did I completely understand
what Demosthenes meant by laying such stress on delivery.
You are to bring before you the venerable figure of the
preacher; his blindness, constantly recalling to your recollection
old Homer, Ossian, and Milton, and associating with
his performance the melancholy grandeur of their geniuses;
you are to imagine that you hear his slow, solemn, well-accented
enunciation, and his voice of affecting trembling
melody; you are to remember the pitch of passion and enthusiasm
to which the congregation were raised; and then
the few moments of portentous, deathlike silence which
reigned throughout the house; the preacher removing his
white handkerchief from his aged face, (even yet wet from
the recent torrent of his tears), and slowly stretching forth
the palsied hand which holds it, begins the sentence, &ldquo;Socrates
died like a philosopher,&rdquo;&mdash;then, pausing, raising his
other hand, pressing them both, clasped together, with
warmth and energy, to his breast, lifting his &ldquo;sightless
balls&rdquo; to heaven, and pouring his whole soul into his tremulous
voice&mdash;&ldquo;but Jesus Christ&mdash;like a God!&rdquo; If it had
indeed and in truth been an angel of light, the effect could
scarcely have been more divine.</p>


<h3>MR. HENRY AGAINST JOHN HOOK.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Life of Patrick Henry.</i>)</p>

<p>Hook was a Scotchman, a man of wealth, and suspected
of being unfriendly to the American cause. During the distresses
of the American army, consequent upon the joint
invasion of Cornwallis and Phillips in 1781, a Mr. Venable,
an army commissary, had taken two of Hook&rsquo;s steers for
the use of the troops. The act had not been strictly legal;
and on the establishment of peace, Hook, under the advice
of Mr. Cowan, a gentleman of some distinction in the law,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
thought proper to bring an action of trespass against Mr.
Venable, in the district court of New London. Mr. Henry
appeared for the defendant, and is said to have disported
himself in this cause to the infinite enjoyment of his hearers,
the unfortunate Hook always excepted. After Mr.
Henry became animated in the cause, says a correspondent
[Judge Stuart], he appeared to have complete control over
the passions of his audience: at one time he excited their
indignation against Hook: vengeance was visible in every
countenance; again, when he chose to relax and ridicule
him, the whole audience was in a roar of laughter. He
painted the distresses of the American army, exposed almost
naked to the rigour of a winter&rsquo;s sky, and marking the
frozen ground over which they marched, with the blood of
their unshod feet&mdash;&ldquo;where was the man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who
had an American heart in his bosom, who would not have
thrown open his fields, his barns, his cellar, the doors of his
house, the portals of his breast, to have received with open
arms, the meanest soldier in that little band of patriots?
Where is the man? <em>There</em> he stands&mdash;but whether the
heart of an American beats in his bosom, you, gentlemen,
are to judge.&rdquo; He then carried the jury, by the powers of
his imagination, to the plains around York, the surrender of
which had followed shortly after the act complained of: he
depicted the surrender in the most glowing and noble colors
of his eloquence&mdash;the audience saw before their eyes the
humiliation and dejection of the British, as they marched
out of their trenches&mdash;they saw the triumph which lighted
up every patriot face, and heard the shouts of victory, and
the cry of &ldquo;Washington and Liberty!&rdquo;, as it rung and
echoed through the American ranks, and was reverberated
from the hills and shores of the neighboring river&mdash;&ldquo;but,
hark!, what notes of discord are these which disturb the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
general joy, and silence the acclamations of victory? They
are the notes of <i>John Hook</i>, hoarsely bawling through the
American camp, <em>beef!</em> <em>beef!</em> <em>beef!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole audience was convulsed: a particular incident
will give a better idea of the effect, than any general description.
The clerk of the court, unable to command himself,
and unwilling to commit any breach of decorum in his
place, rushed out of the court-house, and threw himself on
the grass, in the most violent paroxysm of laughter, where
he was rolling, when Hook, with very different feelings,
came out for relief into the yard also. &ldquo;Jemmy Steptoe,&rdquo;
said he to the clerk, &ldquo;what the devil ails ye, mon?&rdquo; Mr.
Steptoe was only able to say, that <em>he could not help it</em>.
&ldquo;Never mind ye,&rdquo; said Hook, &ldquo;wait till Billy Cowan gets
up: <em>he&rsquo;ll show</em> him the la&rsquo;.&rdquo; Mr. Cowan, however, was so
completely overwhelmed by the torrent which bore upon his
client, that when he rose to reply to Mr. Henry, he was
scarcely able to make an intelligible or audible remark. The
cause was decided almost by acclamation. The jury retired
for form&rsquo;s sake, and instantly returned with a verdict for
the defendant. Nor did the effect of Mr. Henry&rsquo;s speech
stop here. The people were so highly excited by the tory
audacity of such a suit, that Hook began to hear around
him a cry more terrible than that of <em>beef</em>; it was the cry of
<em>tar and feathers</em>: from the application of which, it is said,
that nothing saved him but a precipitate flight and the speed
of his horse.</p>

<h2>JOHN RANDOLPH.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1773=1833.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">John Randolph</span> of Roanoke, was born at Cawson&rsquo;s,
Virginia, being a descendant of Pocahontas in the seventh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
generation. He lost his father early in life. His beautiful
mother, to whom he was devotedly attached, afterwards
married St. George Tucker, who happily was a true father
to her children and educated John himself. Her death in
1788 was a life-long distress to her gifted son.</p>

<p>He was a prominent actor in all the stirring political life
of the times, being in Congress from 1800 until his death,
except from 1812 to 1814, and again in 1830 when he was
minister to Russia, a position which he resigned, however,
in order to return to the excitement of politics at home. He
freed his slaves by will on his death, which occurred in
Philadelphia as he was preparing to go abroad for his health.
Many anecdotes are told of him, and he is one of the most
interesting and striking figures in our history. See Benton&rsquo;s

<h3>THE REVISION OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From a Speech in the Legislature, 1829.</i>)</p>

<p>Doctor Franklin who in shrewdness, especially in all that
related to domestic life, was never excelled, used to say that
two movings were equal to one fire. And gentlemen, as if
they were afraid that this besetting sin of republican governments,
this <i>rerum novarum lubido</i> (to use a very homely
phrase, but that comes pat to the purpose), this maggot of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
innovation, would cease to bite, are here gravely making
provision that this Constitution, which we should consider
as a remedy for all the ills of the body politic, may itself be
amended or modified at any future time. Sir, I am against
any such provision. I should as soon think of introducing
into a marriage contract a provision for divorce, and thus
poisoning the greatest blessing of mankind at its very
source,&mdash;at its fountain-head. He has seen little, and has
reflected less, who does not know that &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; is the
great, powerful, governing principle of affairs here. Sir, I
am not going into that question which puzzled Pandemonium,&mdash;the
question of liberty and necessity,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Free will, fixed fate, foreknowledge absolute;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>but I do contend that necessity is one principal instrument of
all the good that man enjoys. The happiness of the connubial
union itself depends greatly on necessity, and when you
touch this you touch the arch, the keystone of the arch, on
which the happiness and well-being of society is founded.
Look at the relation of master and slave (that opprobrium,
in the opinion of some gentlemen, to all civilized society
and all free government). Sir, there are few situations in
life where friendships so strong and so lasting are formed
as in that very relation. The slave knows that he is bound
indissolubly to his master, and must, from necessity, remain
always under his control. The master knows he is bound
to maintain and provide always for his slave so long as he
retains him in his possession. And each party accommodates
himself to the situation. I have seen the dissolution of many
friendships,&mdash;such, at least, as they were called; but I have
seen that of master and slave endure so long as there remained
a drop of blood of the master to which the slave could cleave.</p>

<p>Where is the necessity of this provision in the Constitution?
Where is the use of it? Sir, what are we about?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
Have we not been undoing what the wiser heads&mdash;I
must be permitted to say so&mdash;yes, Sir, what the wiser heads
of our ancestors did more than half a century ago? Can
any one believe that we, by any amendment of ours, by any
of our scribbling on that parchment, by any amulet, by any
legerdemain&mdash;charm&mdash;Abracadabra&mdash;of ours can prevent
our sons from doing the same thing,&mdash;that is, from doing
what they please, just as we are doing as we please? It is
impossible. Who can bind posterity? When I hear gentlemen
talk of making a Constitution for &ldquo;all time,&rdquo; and
introducing provisions into it for &ldquo;all time,&rdquo; and yet see
men here who are older than the Constitution we are about
to destroy (I am older myself than the present Constitution:
it was established when I was a boy), it reminds me of the
truces and the peaces of Europe. They always begin, &ldquo;In
the name of the most holy and undivided Trinity,&rdquo; and go
on to declare &ldquo;there shall be perfect and perpetual peace
and unity between the subjects of such and such potentates
for all time to come;&rdquo; and in less than seven years they are
at war again.</p>

<h3>JEFFERSON&rsquo;S PREFERENCE FOR COUNTRY LIFE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Life of Jefferson.</i>)</p>

<p>He tells the Baron that he is savage enough to prefer the
woods, the wilds, and the independence of Monticello, to
all the brilliant pleasures of the gay metropolis of France.
&ldquo;I shall therefore,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;rejoin myself to my native
country, with new attachments, and with exaggerated esteem
for its advantages; for though there is less wealth
there, there is more freedom, more ease, and less misery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Declarations of this kind often originate in insincerity
and affectation; sometimes from the wish to appear superior
to those sensual indulgences and light amusements which
are to be obtained only in cities, and sometimes from the
pride of seeming to despise what is beyond our reach. But
the sentiment here expressed by Mr. Jefferson is truly felt
by many an American, and we have no reason to doubt it
was felt also by him. There is a charm in the life which
one has been accustomed to in his youth, no matter what
the modes of that life may have been, which always retains
its hold on the heart. The Indian who has passed his first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
years with his tribe, is never reconciled to the habits and
restraints of civilized life. And although in more artificial
and advanced stages of society, individuals, whether they
have been brought up in the town or the country, are not
equally irreconcilable to a change from one to the other, it
commonly takes some time to overcome their preference for
the life they have been accustomed to; and in many instances
it is never overcome, but continues to haunt the imagination
with pleasing pictures of the past or imaginations
of the future, when hope gives assurance that those scenes
of former enjoyment may be renewed. That most of our
country gentlemen, past the heyday of youth, would soon
tire of Paris, and pant after the simple pleasures and exemption
from restraint which their own country affords, is
little to be wondered at; but it is the more remarkable in
Mr. Jefferson, and more clearly illustrates the force of early
habit, when it is recollected that he found in the French
metropolis that society of men of letters and science which
he must often have in vain coveted in his own country, and
that here he met with those specimens of music, painting,
and architecture, for which he had so lively a relish. But
in these comparisons between the life we are leading and
that which we have left, or are looking forward to, we must
always allow much to the force of the imagination, and
there are few men who felt its influence more than Mr. Jefferson.
In one of his letters to Mr. Carmichael, he says, &ldquo;I
sometimes think of building a little hermitage at the Natural
Bridge, (for it is my property), and of passing there a part
of the year at least.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the Same.</i>)</p>

<p>We have seen that the subject of education had long been
a favourite object with Mr. Jefferson, partly from his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
lively relish for literature and science, and partly because he
deemed the diffusion of knowledge among the people essential
to the wise administration of a popular government,
and even to its stability. He had not long retired from
public life, before the subject again engaged his serious attention,
and, besides endeavouring to enlist men of influence
in behalf of his favourite scheme of dividing the counties
of the State into wards, and giving the charge of its
elementary schools to these little commonwealths, he also
aimed to establish a college, in the neighbourhood of Charlottesville,
for teaching the higher branches of knowledge,
and which, from its central and healthy situation, might be
improved into a university.</p>

<p>He lived to see this object accomplished, and it owed its
success principally to his efforts. It engrossed his attention
for more than eleven years, in which time he exhibited his
wonted judgment and address, in overcoming the numerous
obstacles he encountered, and a diligence and perseverance
which would have been creditable to the most vigorous period
of life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>In getting the university into operation, he seemed to
have regained the activity and assiduity of his youth.
Everything was looked into, everything was ordered by
him. He suggested the remedy for every difficulty, and
made the selection in every choice of expedients. Two or
three times a week he rode down to the establishment to
give orders to the proctor, and to watch the progress of the
work still unfinished. Nor were his old habits of hospitality
forgotten. His invitations to the professors and their
families were frequent, and every Sunday some four or five
of the students dined with him. At these times he generally
ate by himself in a small recess connected with the dining-room;
but, saving at meals, sat and conversed with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
company as usual. The number of visiters also to the University
was very great, and they seldom failed to call at
Monticello, where they often passed the day, and sometimes
several days. He was so fully occupied with his duties, as
rector of the university, and he found so much pleasure in
the occupation, that for a time every cause of care and
anxiety, of which he now began to have an increased share,
was entirely forgotten; and the sun of his life seemed to be
setting with a soft but unclouded radiance.</p>

<p class="center"><b>1777=1852.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Henry Clay</span> was born at &ldquo;The Slashes,&rdquo; Hanover
County, Virginia, whence he got his title, &ldquo;Mill-Boy of the
Slashes.&rdquo; His mother, early left a widow, was poor, and
on her second marriage, to Mr. Henry Watkins, removed to
Kentucky. Henry Clay became a clerk and then a law-student
in Richmond, Va., and in 1797 followed his mother to
Kentucky, making his home in Lexington. He rose speedily
to eminence as a jury lawyer, and in 1803 entered public
life as a member of the State Legislature. In 1806 he entered
the United States Senate, and after the war of 1812
he was sent to Belgium as one of the Commissioners to treat
of peace with Great Britain.</p>

<p>His share in public life was most important. He was the
author of the Missouri Compromise of 1820, of the Tariff
Compromise of 1832, of the Bill for Protection and Internal
Improvements; his agency in the first two and in the Missouri
Compromise of 1850, gaining for him the title of the
&ldquo;Great Pacificator.&rdquo; With Calhoun and Webster, he formed
the triad of great statesmen who made illustrious our politics
in the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>He died in Washington City and was buried in Lexington,
Kentucky, where an imposing column, surmounted by
his statue, marks his tomb. In the Capitol grounds at Richmond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
there is also a fine monument and statue to his memory.
It has been said of him that no man ever had more
devoted friends and more bitter enemies. See Benton&rsquo;s account
of his duel with Randolph.</p>

<p>His home, &ldquo;Ashland,&rdquo; on the suburbs of Lexington, is
now a part of the University of Kentucky. The old Court
House in which so many of his famous speeches were made
still stands in Lexington, and is cherished as an honoured
reminder of his greatness in the eyes of his admiring compatriots.

of his country, the confident and indignant Grecian would
exclaim, No! no! we have nothing to fear from our heroes;
our liberties shall be eternal. If a Roman citizen had been
asked whether he did not fear that the conqueror of Gaul
might establish a throne upon the ruins of public liberty,
he would have instantly repelled the unjust insinuation.
Yet Greece fell; C&aelig;sar passed the Rubicon, and the patriotic
arm even of Brutus could not preserve the liberties of
his devoted country. The celebrated Madame de Sta&euml;l,
in her last and perhaps her best work, has said that in
the very year, almost the very month, when the president
of the Directory declared that monarchy would
never show its frightful head in France, Bonaparte with
his grenadiers entered the palace of St. Cloud, and, dispersing
with the bayonet the deputies of the people, deliberating
on the affairs of the state, laid the foundation
of that vast fabric of despotism which overshadowed all
Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
I hope not to be misunderstood; I am far from intimating
that General Jackson cherishes any designs inimical to the
liberties of the country. I believe his intentions to be pure
and patriotic. I thank God that he would not, but I thank
Him still more that he could not if he would, overturn the
liberties of the Republic. But precedents, if bad, are
fraught with the most dangerous consequences. Man has
been described, by some of those who have treated of his
nature, as a bundle of habits. The definition is much truer
when applied to governments. Precedents are their habits.
There is one important difference between the formation of
habits by an individual and by government. He contracts
it only after frequent repetition. A single instance fixes
the habit and determines the direction of governments.</p>

<p>Against the alarming doctrine of unlimited discretion in
our military commanders, when applied to prisoners of war,
I must enter my protest. It begins upon them; it will end
on us. I hope our happy form of government is to be perpetual.
But if it is to be preserved, it must be by the
practice of virtue, by justice, by moderation, by magnanimity,
by greatness of soul, by keeping a watchful and steady
eye on the executive; and, above all, by holding to a strict
accountability the military branch of the public
force.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Beware how you give
a fatal sanction, in this infant period of our republic,
scarcely yet two score years old, to military insubordination.
Remember that Greece had her Alexander, Rome her C&aelig;sar,
England her Cromwell, France her Bonaparte, and that, if
we would escape the rock on which they split, we must
avoid their errors.</p>

<h2>FRANCIS SCOTT KEY.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1780=1843.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Francis Scott Key</span> was born in Frederick county, Maryland,
and was educated at St. John&rsquo;s College, Annapolis. He
became a lawyer, was appointed District Attorney of the
District of Columbia, and spent his life in Washington City.</p>

<p>A very handsome monument has been erected to his
memory in San Francisco by Mr. James Lick: his song, the
&ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner,&rdquo; will be his enduring monument
throughout our country. It was composed during the attack
on Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor, 1814. Key had
gone to the British vessel to get a friend released from imprisonment,
in which he succeeded, but he was kept on
board the enemy&rsquo;s vessel until after the attack on the fort;
and the song commemorates his evening and morning watch
for the star-spangled banner on Fort McHenry, and the appearance
of the flag in &ldquo;the morning&rsquo;s first beam&rdquo; showed
that the attack had been successfully resisted. The words
were written on an old envelope. (See illustrations in the
<i>Century Magazine</i>, July, 1894.)</p>

<h2>JOHN JAMES AUDUBON.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1780=1851.</b></p>

<img src="images/sl23.jpg" width="600" height="451" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">Scene in Louisiana.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">John James Audubon</span> was born near New Orleans and
educated in France where he studied painting under David.
While still a young man, his father put him in charge of a
country estate in Pennsylvania. Afterwards he engaged in
mercantile persuits in Philadelphia, Louisville, New Orleans,
and Henderson, Kentucky, but unsuccessfully; for he knew
and cared much more about the birds, flowers, and beasts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
around him than about the kinds and prices of goods that
his neighbors needed.</p>

<p>His great literary and artistic work is &ldquo;The Birds of
America,&rdquo; consisting of five volumes of Ornithological Biographies
and four volumes of exquisite portraits of birds,
life-size, in natural colors, and surrounded by the plants
which each one most likes. &ldquo;Quadrupeds of America&rdquo; was
prepared mainly by his sons and Rev. John Bachman of
South Carolina. These works gave him a European reputation.
He died at Minniesland, now Audubon Park, New
York City.</p>

<p>His style in writing is pure, vivid, and so clear as to place
before us the very thing or event described. The accounts
of his travels and of the adventures he met with in his
search for his birds and animals are very natural and picturesque;
and they show also his own fine nature and attractive
character.</p>

<p>A biography arranged from his diary by Mrs. Audubon
was published in New York, 1868. See also Samuel Smiles&rsquo;
&ldquo;Brief Biographies.&rdquo; The State Library of North Carolina
possesses a set of Audubon&rsquo;s invaluable works, of which
there are only eight sets in America.</p>


<h3>THE MOCKING-BIRD.</h3>

<p>It is where the great magnolia shoots up its majestic
trunk, crowned with evergreen leaves, and decorated with
a thousand beautiful flowers, that perfume the air around;
where the forests and the fields are adorned with blossoms
of every hue; where the golden orange ornaments the gardens
and groves; where bignonias of various kinds interlace
their climbing stems around the white-flowered Stuartia,
and, mounting still higher, cover the summits of the lofty
trees around, accompanied with innumerable vines, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
here and there festoon the dense foliage of the magnificent
woods, lending to the vernal breeze a slight portion of the
perfume of their clustered flowers; where a genial warmth
seldom forsakes the atmosphere; where berries and fruits of
all descriptions are met with at every step; in a word, kind
reader, it is where Nature seems to have paused, as she
passed over the earth, and, opening her stores, to have
strewed with unsparing hand the diversified seeds from
which have sprung all the beautiful and splendid forms
which I should in vain attempt to describe, that the mocking-bird
should have fixed his abode, there only that its
wondrous song should be heard.</p>

<p>But where is that favored land? It is in that great continent
to whose distant shores Europe has sent forth her adventurous
sons, to wrest for themselves a habitation from
the wild inhabitants of the forest, and to convert the neglected
soil into fields of exuberant fertility. It is, reader,
in Louisiana that these bounties of nature are in the greatest
perfection. It is there that you should listen to the love-song
of the mocking-bird, as I at this moment do. See how
he flies round his mate, with motions as light as those of the
butterfly! His tail is widely expanded, he mounts in the
air to a small distance, describes a circle, and, again alighting,
approaches his beloved one, his eyes gleaming with delight,
for she has already promised to be his and his only.
His beautiful wings are gently raised, he bows to his love,
and, again bouncing upwards, opens his bill and pours forth
his melody, full of exultation at the conquest which he has
made.</p>

<p>They are not the soft sounds of the flute or of the hautboy
that I hear, but the sweeter notes of Nature&rsquo;s own
music. The mellowness of the song, the varied modulations
and gradations, the extent of its compass, the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
brilliancy of execution, are unrivalled. There is probably
no bird in the world that possesses all the musical qualifications
of this king of song, who has derived all from
Nature&rsquo;s self. Yes, reader, all!</p>

<p>No sooner has he again alighted, and the conjugal contract
has been sealed, than, as if his breast was about to be rent
with delight, he again pours forth his notes with more softness
and richness than before. He now soars higher, glancing
around with a vigilant eye to assure himself that none
has witnessed his bliss. When these love-scenes, visible
only to the ardent lover of nature, are over, he dances
through the air, full of animation and delight, and as if to
convince his lovely mate that to enrich her hopes he has
much more love in store, he that moment begins anew and
imitates all the notes which Nature has imparted to the
other songsters of the grove.</p>


<h3>THE HUMMING-BIRD.</h3>

<p>No sooner has the returning sun again introduced the vernal
season, and caused millions of plants to expand their leaves
and blossoms to his genial beams, than the little Humming-Bird
is seen advancing on fairy wings, carefully visiting
every opening flower-cup, and, like a curious florist, removing
from each the injurious insects that otherwise would ere
long cause their beauteous petals to droop and decay.
Poised in the air, it is observed peeping cautiously, and with
sparkling eyes, into their innermost recesses, while the ethereal
motions of its pinions, so rapid and so light, appear to
fan and cool the flower, without injuring its fragile texture,
and produce a delightful murmuring sound, well adapted
for lulling the insects to repose. Then is the moment for
the Humming-Bird to secure them. Its long delicate bill
enters the cup of the flower, and the protruded double-tubed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
tongue, delicately sensible, and imbued with a glutinous
saliva, touches each insect in succession, and draws it from
its lurking place, to be instantly swallowed. All this is
done in a moment, and the bird, as it leaves the flower, sips
so small a portion of its liquid honey, that the theft, we may
suppose, is looked upon with a grateful feeling by the flower,
which is thus kindly relieved from the attacks of her
destroyers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Its gorgeous throat in beauty and brilliancy baffles all competition.
Now it glows with a fiery hue, and again it is
changed to the deepest velvety black. The upper parts of
its delicate body are of resplendent changing green; and it
throws itself through the air with a swiftness and vivacity
hardly conceivable. It moves from one flower to another
like a gleam of light, upwards, downwards, to the right,
and to the left.</p>

<h2>THOMAS HART BENTON.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1782=1858.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Hart Benton</span> was born in Hillsboro, North
Carolina, and was partly educated at the State University.
He left before graduation, however, and removed with his
widowed mother to Tennessee, where twenty-five miles
south of Nashville they made a home, around which a settlement
called Bentontown gradually grew up.</p>

<p>He studied law with St. George Tucker, began to practice
in Nashville, and was elected to the State Legislature
in 1811. In 1815 he removed to St. Louis, and was elected
United States Senator in 1820 on the admission of Missouri
to the Union. He worked heartily and successfully in the
interests of settlers in the West. His title &ldquo;Old Bullion&rdquo;
was derived from his famous speeches on the currency,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
during Jackson&rsquo;s administration, and they gained him a
European reputation.</p>

<p>He and Calhoun were opposed to each other on almost
every question, and they carried on a ferocious warfare in the
Senate. He was a Senator for thirty years, 1820-50, and
his great work gives an account of men and measures during
that very exciting and intensely interesting period, in which
he was himself one of the most prominent actors.</p>

<p>A fine statue was erected to him in the park at St. Louis.</p>

arrangement and for a style easy and fluent yet not diffuse.

<h3>THE DUEL BETWEEN RANDOLPH AND CLAY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Thirty Years&rsquo; View.</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>)</p>

<p>Saturday, the 8th of April (1826)&mdash;the day for the duel&mdash;had
come, and almost the hour. It was noon, and the meeting
was to take place at 4&frac12; o&rsquo;clock. I had gone to see
Mr. Randolph before the hour, and for a purpose; and, besides,
it was so far on the way, as he lived half-way to
Georgetown, and we had to pass through that place to cross
the Potomac into Virginia at the Little Falls Bridge. I
had heard nothing from him on the point of not returning
the fire since the first communication to that effect, eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
days before. I had no reason to doubt the steadiness of his
determination, but felt a desire to have fresh assurance of it
after so many days&rsquo; delay, and so near approach of the trying
moment. I knew it would not do to ask him the question&mdash;any
question which would imply a doubt of his word.
His sensitive feelings would be hurt and annoyed at it. So I
fell upon a scheme to get at the inquiry without seeming to
make it. I told him of my visit to Mr. Clay the night before&mdash;of
the late sitting&mdash;the child asleep&mdash;the unconscious
tranquillity of Mrs. Clay; and added, I could not help reflecting
how different all that might be the next night. He
understood me perfectly, and immediately said, with a
quietude of look and expression which seemed to rebuke
an unworthy doubt, <i>I shall do nothing to disturb the sleep
of the child or the repose of the mother</i>, and went on with
his employment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;which
was, making codicils to his will, all in the way of remembrance
to friends.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I withdrew a little way
into the woods, and kept my eyes fixed on Mr. Randolph,
who I then knew to be the only one in danger. I saw him
receive the fire of Mr. Clay, saw the gravel knocked up in
the same place, saw Mr. Randolph raise his pistol&mdash;discharge
it in the air; heard him say, <i>I do not fire at you, Mr.
Clay</i>; and immediately advancing and offering his hand.
He was met in the same spirit. They met halfway, shook
hands, Mr. Randolph saying, jocosely, <i>You owe me a coat,
Mr. Clay</i>&mdash;(the bullet had passed through the skirt of the
coat, very near the hip)&mdash;to which Mr. Clay promptly and
happily replied, <i>I am glad the debt is no greater</i>. I had
come up and was prompt to proclaim what I had been
obliged to keep secret for eight days. The joy of all was
extreme at this happy termination of a most critical affair:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
and we immediately left, with lighter hearts than we
brought.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>On Monday the parties exchanged cards, and social relations
were formally and courteously restored. It was about
the last high-toned duel that I have witnessed, and among
the highest-toned that I have ever witnessed; and so happily
conducted to a fortunate issue&mdash;a result due to the noble
character of the seconds as well as to the generous and
heroic spirit of the principals. Certainly, duelling is bad,
and has been put down, but not quite so bad as its substitute&mdash;revolvers,
bowie-knives, blackguarding, and street-assassinations
under the pretext of self-defence.</p>

<h2>JOHN CALDWELL CALHOUN.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1782=1850.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">John Caldwell Calhoun</span> is one of the greatest statesmen
that America has produced. He was of Scotch and Irish
descent, and was born in Abbeville County, South Carolina.
He received his early education from his brother-in-law, the
distinguished Dr. Moses Waddell, then attended Yale College,
and studied law. Early in life, 1811, he entered the
political arena, and remained in it to the day of his death.</p>

<p>As Secretary of War under President Monroe, he re-organized
the department on the basis which is still maintained.
He was elected Vice-president with Adams in 1824,
re-elected with Jackson, 1828, and became United States
Senator, 1832, succeeding Robert Y. Hayne who had been
chosen governor of South Carolina in the Nullification
crisis.</p>

<p>From this time forth until his death, he was in the midst
of incessant political toil, strife, and activity, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
Webster, Clay, Benton, Hayne, Randolph, Grundy, Hunter, and
Cass, for his great companions. Edward Everett said:
&ldquo;Calhoun, Clay, Webster! I name them in alphabetical
order. What other precedence can be assigned them?
Clay the great leader, Webster the great orator, Calhoun
the great thinker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a boy he must often have heard his father say, &ldquo;That
government is the best which allows the largest amount of
individual liberty compatible with social order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His most famous political act is his advocacy of Nullification,
an explanation and defence of which are found in
the extract below. He was a devoted adherent of the
Union. (See under <i>Jefferson Davis</i>.)</p>

<p>His life seems to have been entirely political; but he was
very fond of his home where there was always a cheerful
happy household. This home, &ldquo;Fort Hill,&rdquo; was in the
lovely upland region of South Carolina in Oconee County.
It became the property of his daughter, Mrs. Thomas G.
Clemson, and Mr. Clemson left it at his death to the State,
which has now established there an Agricultural and Mechanical
College.</p>

<p>Mr. Calhoun died in Washington City, and was buried
in St. Philip&rsquo;s Churchyard, Charleston, his grave being
marked by a monument. His preeminence in South Carolina
during his life has not ceased with his death. His
picture is found everywhere and his memory is still living
throughout the entire country. See Life, by Jenkins,
and by Von Hoist. See under <i>Stephens</i>.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 2em;">Calhoun has been called the philosopher of statesmen,
and his style accords with this description. &ldquo;His eloquence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
was part of his intellectual character. It was plain, strong,
terse, condensed, concise; sometimes impassioned, still always
severe. Rejecting ornament, not often seeking far
for illustration, his power consisted in the plainness of his
propositions, in the closeness of his logic, and in the earnestness
and energy of his manner.&rdquo;&mdash;Daniel Webster.</p>

<h3>SYSTEM OF OUR GOVERNMENT.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Speech on State Rights and Union, 1834.</i>)</p>

<p>I know of no system, ancient or modern, to be compared
with it; and can compare it to nothing but that sublime
and beautiful system of which our globe constitutes a part,
and to which it bears, in many particulars, so striking a resemblance.</p>


<h3>DEFENCE OF NULLIFICATION.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From a Speech against the Force Bill, after the State of South Carolina had passed the
Ordinance of Nullification, 1833.</i>)</p>

<p>A deep constitutional question lies at the bottom of the
controversy. The real question at issue is, Has the government
a right to impose burdens on the capital and industry
of one portion of the country, not with a view to revenue,
but to benefit another? and I must be permitted to say that
after a long and deep agitation of this controversy, it is with
surprise that I perceive so strong a disposition to misrepresent
its real character. To correct the impression which
those misrepresentations are calculated to make, I will dwell
on the point under consideration a few moments longer.</p>

<p>The Federal Government has, by an express provision of
the Constitution, the right to lay duties on imports. The
state never denied or resisted this right, nor even thought of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
so doing. The government has, however, not been contented
with exercising this power as she had a right to do,
but has gone a step beyond it, by laying imposts, not for
revenue, but for protection. This the state considers as an
unconstitutional exercise of power, highly injurious and oppressive
to her and the other staple states, and has accordingly,
met it with the most determined resistance. I do not
intend to enter, at this time, into the argument as to the
unconstitutionality of the protective system. It is not necessary.
It is sufficient that the power is nowhere granted;
and that, from the journals of the Convention which formed
the Constitution, it would seem that it was refused. In support
of the journals, I might cite the statement of Luther
Martin, which has already been referred to, to show that the
Convention, so far from conferring the power on the Federal
Government, left to the state the right to impose duties on
imports, with the express view of enabling the several states
to protect their own manufactures. Notwithstanding this,
Congress has assumed, without any warrant from the Constitution,
the right of exercising this most important power,
and has so exercised it as to impose a ruinous burden on the
labor and capital of the state of South Carolina, by which
her resources are exhausted, the enjoyments of her citizens
curtailed, the means of education contracted, and all her interests
essentially and injuriously affected.</p>

<p>We have been sneeringly told that she is a small state;
that her population does not exceed half a million of souls;
and that more than one half are not of the European race.
The facts are so. I know she never can be a great state, and
that the only distinction to which she can aspire must be
based on the moral and intellectual acquirements of her sons.
To the development of these much of her attention has been
directed; but this restrictive system, which has so unjustly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
exacted the proceeds of her labor, to be bestowed on other
sections, has so impaired the resources of the state, that, if
not speedily arrested, it will dry up the means of education,
and with it deprive her of the only source through which
she can aspire to distinction.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The people of the state believe that the Union is a union
of states, and not of individuals; that it was formed by the
states, and that the citizens of the several states were bound
to it through the acts of their several states; that each state
ratified the Constitution for itself; and that it was only by
such ratification of a state that any obligation was imposed
upon the citizens; thus believing, it is the opinion of the
people of Carolina, that it belongs to the state which has
imposed the obligation to declare, in the last resort, the extent
of this obligation, so far as her citizens are concerned;
and this upon the plain principles which exist in all analogous
cases of compact between sovereign bodies. On this
principle, the people of the state, acting in their sovereign
capacity in convention, precisely as they adopted their own
and the federal Constitution, have declared by the ordinance,
that the acts of Congress which imposed duties under the
authority to lay imposts, are acts, not for revenue, as intended
by the Constitution, but for protection, and therefore
null and void.</p>

was decidedly healthful.&rdquo;]</p>

<h3>THE WISE CHOICE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From a speech in 1816.</i>)</p>

<p>This country is now in a situation similar to that which
one of the most beautiful writers of antiquity ascribes to
Hercules in his youth. He represents the hero as retiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
into the wilderness to deliberate on the course of life which
he ought to choose. Two goddesses approach him; one
recommending a life of ease and pleasure; the other, of
labor and virtue. The hero adopts the counsel of the latter,
and his fame and glory are known to the world. May this
country, the youthful Hercules, possessing his form and
muscles, be animated by similar sentiments, and follow his
example!</p>


<h3>OFFICIAL PATRONAGE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Speech in the Senate, 1835.</i>)</p>

<p>Their object is to get and hold office; and their leading
political maxim&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is that, &ldquo;to the
victors belong the spoils of victory!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Can any one, who will duly reflect on these things, venture
to say that all is sound, and that our Government is not
undergoing a great and fatal change? Let us not deceive
ourselves, the very essence of a free government consists in
considering <em>offices as public trusts</em>, bestowed for the good of
the country, and not for the benefit of an individual or a
party; and that system of political morals which regards
offices in a different light, as <em>public prizes</em> to be won by
combatants most skilled in all the arts and corruption of
political tactics, and to be used and enjoyed as their proper
spoils&mdash;strikes a fatal blow at the very vitals of free institutions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[The scene is laid in Virginia, near the close of the year 1849. By
a long series of encroachments by the federal government on the
rights and powers of the states, our federative system is supposed to
be destroyed, and a consolidated government, with the forms of a
republic and the powers of a monarchy, to be established on its ruins.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

is but too probably correct. We trust that a benign Providence will

Lit. Messenger, Jan., 1837.]</p>
</div>

<p>Toward the latter end of the month of October, 1849,
about the hour of noon, a horseman was seen ascending a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
narrow valley at the Eastern foot of the Blue Ridge. His
road nearly followed the course of a small stream, which,
issuing from a deep gorge of the mountain, winds its way
between lofty hills, and terminates its brief and brawling
course in one of the larger tributaries of the Dan. A glance
of the eye took in the whole of the little settlement that
lined its banks, and measured the resources of its inhabitants.
The different tenements were so near to each other as to
allow but a small patch of arable land to each. Of manufactures
there was no appearance, save only a rude shed at
the entrance of the valley, on the door of which the oft-repeated
brand of the horseshoe gave token of a smithy.
There, too, the rivulet, increased by the innumerable springs
which afforded to every habitation the unappreciated, but
inappreciable luxury of water, cold, clear, and sparkling,
had gathered strength enough to turn a tiny mill. Of trade
there could be none. The bleak and rugged barrier, which
closed the scene on the west, and the narrow road, fading to
a foot-path, gave assurance to the traveller that he had here
reached the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of social life in that direction.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
At length he heard a sound of
voices, and then a shrill whistle, and all was still. Immediately,
some half a dozen men, leaping a fence, ranged
themselves across the road and faced him. He observed
that each, as he touched the ground, laid hold of a rifle that
leaned against the enclosure, and this circumstance drew his
attention to twenty or more of these formidable weapons,
ranged along in the same position.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
As the traveller drew up his horse, one of the men, speaking
in a low and quiet tone, said, &ldquo;We want a word with you,
stranger, before you go any farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As many as you please,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;for I am
tired and hungry, and so is my horse; and I am glad to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
some one at last, of whom I may hope to purchase something
for both of us to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>That</em> you can have quite handy,&rdquo; said the countryman, &ldquo;for
we have been gathering corn, and were just going to our dinner.
If you will only just &rsquo;light, sir, one of the boys can feed
your horse, and you can take such as we have got to give you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted; the horse was taken in
charge by a long-legged lad of fifteen, without hat or shoes;
and the whole party crossed the fence together.</p>

<p>At the moment a man was seen advancing toward them,
who, observing their approach, fell back a few steps, and
threw himself on the ground at the foot of a large old apple-tree.
Around this were clustered a motley group of men,
women, and boys, who opened and made way for the
stranger. He advanced, and bowing gracefully took off his
forage cap, from beneath which a quantity of soft curling
flaxen hair fell over his brow and cheeks. Every eye was
now fixed on him, with an expression rather of interest than
of mere curiosity. Every countenance was serious and composed,
and all wore an air of business, except that a slight
titter was heard among the girls, who, hovering behind the
backs of their mothers, peeped through the crowd, to get a
look at the handsome stranger.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>As the youth approached, the man at the foot of the tree
arose, and returned the salutation, which seemed unheeded
by the rest. He advanced a step or two and invited the
stranger to be seated. This action, and the looks turned towards
him by the others, showed that he was in authority of
some sort among them. With him, therefore, our traveller
concluded that the proposed conference was to be
held.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>He was at length asked whence he came, and answered,
from the neighborhood of Richmond.&mdash;From which side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
the river?&mdash;From the north side.&mdash;Did he know anything of
Van Courtlandt?&mdash;His camp was at Bacon&rsquo;s branch, just
above the town.&mdash;What force had he?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say, certainly,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but common fame
made his numbers about four thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all, on both sides of the river?&rdquo; said his interrogator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no! Col. Loyal&rsquo;s regiment is at Petersburg, and Col.
Cole&rsquo;s at Manchester; each about five hundred strong; and
there is a piquet on the Bridge Island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you cross there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where, then?&rdquo; he was asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hardly tell you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it was at a private
ford, several miles above Cartersville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was not that mightily out of the way? What made
you come so far around?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was safer travelling on that side of the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the people on that side of the river are your
friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. They are not. But, as they are all of a color there,
they would let me pass, and ask no questions, as long as I
travelled due west. On this side, if you are one man&rsquo;s
friend, you are the next man&rsquo;s enemy; and I had no mind
to answer questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to answer them now mighty freely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true. I am like a letter that tells all it knows as
soon as it gets to the right hand; but it does not want to be
opened before that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how do you know that you have got to the right
hand now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I know where I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
&ldquo;Just at the foot of the Devil&rsquo;s-Backbone,&rdquo; replied the
youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you ever here before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know then where you are?&rdquo; asked the
mountaineer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the right way to avoid questions is to ask none.
So I took care to know all about the road, and the country,
and the place, before I left home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who told you all about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I should tell you,&rdquo; answered the young man,
&ldquo;that Van Courtlandt had a map of the country made, and
gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say you were a traitor to him, or a spy upon us,&rdquo;
was the stern reply.</p>

<p>At the same moment, a startled hum was heard from the
crowd, and the press moved and swayed for an instant, as if
a sort of spasm had pervaded the whole mass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a good hand at questioning,&rdquo; said the youth,
with a smile, &ldquo;but without asking a single question, I have
found out all I wanted to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was that?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether you were friends to the Yorkers and Yankees,
or to poor old Virginia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And which <em>are</em> we for?&rdquo; added the laconic mountaineer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For <em>old Virginia forever</em>,&rdquo; replied the youth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It was echoed in a shout,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
their proud war-cry of &ldquo;<em>old Virginia forever</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>DAVID CROCKETT.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1786=1836.</b></p>


<p>This renowned hunter and pioneer, commonly called
Davy Crockett, was born in Limestone, Green County, Tennessee.
His free and wild youth was spent in hunting.
He became a soldier in the war of 1812: he was elected to
the Tennessee Legislature in 1821 and 1823, and to Congress
in 1829 and 1833. His eccentricity of manners, his lack of
education, and his strong common sense and shrewdness
made him a marked figure, especially in Washington. In
1835 he went to Texas to aid in the struggle for independence;
and in 1836, was massacred by General Santa
Anna, with five other prisoners, after the surrender of the
Alamo, these six being the only survivors of a band of one
hundred and forty Texans. See Life by Edward S. Ellis.</p>

<h3>SPELLING AND GRAMMAR&mdash;HIS PROLOGUE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett, of the State of Tennessee. Written
by Himself. 1834.</i>)</p>

<p class="caption">Alamo, San Antonio, Texas.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know of anything in my book to be criticised on by
honourable men. Is it on my spelling?&mdash;that&rsquo;s not my trade.
Is it on my grammar?&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t time to learn it, and make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
no pretensions to it. Is it on the order and arrangement of
my book?&mdash;I never wrote one before, and never read very
many; and, of course, know mighty little about that. Will
it be on the authorship of the book?&mdash;this I claim, and I&rsquo;ll
hang on to it, like a wax plaster. The whole book is my
own, and every sentiment and sentence in it. I would not
be such a fool, or knave either, as to deny that I have had
it hastily run over by a friend or so, and that some little
alterations have been made in the spelling and grammar;
and I am not so sure that it is not the worse of even that,
for I despise this way of spelling contrary to nature. And
as for grammar, it&rsquo;s pretty much a thing of nothing at last,
after all the fuss that&rsquo;s made about it. In some places, I
wouldn&rsquo;t suffer either the spelling, or grammar, or anything
else to be touch&rsquo;d; and therefore it will be found in my own
way.</p>

<p>But if anybody complains that I have had it looked over,
I can only say to him, her, or them&mdash;as the case may be&mdash;that
while critics were learning grammar, and learning to
spell, I, and &ldquo;Doctor Jackson, L.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;D.&rdquo; were fighting in
the wars; and if our books, and messages, and proclamations,
and cabinet writings, and so forth, and so on, should
need a little looking over, and a little correcting of the
spelling and grammar to make them fit for use, it&rsquo;s just nobody&rsquo;s
business. Big men have more important matters to
attend to than crossing their <i>t&rsquo;s</i> and dotting their <i>i&rsquo;s</i>&mdash;, and
such like small things.</p>


<h3>ON A BEAR HUNT.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the Life of David Crockett. Written by Himself. 1834.</i>)</p>

<p>It was mighty dark, and was difficult to see my way or
anything else. When I got up the hill, I found I had passed
the dogs, and so I turned and went to them. I found, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
I got there, they had treed the bear in a large forked poplar,
and it was setting in the fork. I could see the lump,
but not plain enough to shoot with any certainty, as there
was no moonlight; and so I set in to hunting for some dry
brush to make me a light; but I could find none.</p>

<p>At last I thought I could shoot by guess, and kill him;
so I pointed as near the lump as I could, and fired away.
But the bear didn&rsquo;t come; he only clomb up higher, and got
out on a limb, which helped me to see him better. I now
loaded up again and fired, but this time he didn&rsquo;t move at all.
I commenced loading for a third fire, but the first thing I
knowed the bear was down among my dogs, and they were
fighting all around me. I had my big butcher in my belt, and I
had a pair of dressed buckskin breeches on. So I took out my
knife, and stood, determined, if he should get hold of me,
to defend myself in the best way I could. I stood there for
some time, and could now and then see a white dog I had,
but the rest of them, and the bear, which were dark coloured,
I couldn&rsquo;t see at all, it was so miserable dark. They
still fought around me, and sometimes within three feet of
me; but, at last, the bear got down into one of the cracks that
the earthquake had made in the ground, about four feet
deep, and I could tell the biting end of him by the hollering
of my dogs. So I took my gun and pushed the muzzle
of it about, till I thought I had it against the main part of
his body, and fired; but it happened to be only the fleshy
part of his foreleg. With this, I jumped out of the crack,
and he and the dogs had another hard fight around me, as
before. At last, however, they forced him back into the
crack again, as he was when I had shot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I made a lounge with my long knife, and fortunately
stuck him right through the heart; at which he just sank
down, and I crawled out in a hurry. In a little while my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
dogs all come out too, and seemed satisfied, which was the
way they always had of telling me that they had finished
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>We prepared for resting that night, and I can a-sure the
reader I was in need of it. We had laid down by our fire,
and about ten o&rsquo;clock there came a most terrible earthquake,
which shook the earth so, that we were rocked about like
we had been in a cradle. We were very much alarmed;
for though we were accustomed to feel earthquakes, we
were now right in the region which had been torn to pieces
by them in 1812, and we thought it might take a notion and
swallow us up, like the big fish did Jonah.</p>

<p>In the morning we packed up and moved to the harricane,
where we made another camp, and turned out that
evening and killed a very large bear, which made <em>eight</em> we
had now killed in this hunt.</p>

<p>The next morning we entered the harricane again, and in
little or no time my dogs were in full cry. We pursued
them, and soon came to a thick cane-brake in which they
had stopp&rsquo;d their bear. We got up close to him, as the cane
was so thick that we couldn&rsquo;t see more than a few feet.
Here I made my friend hold the cane a little open with his
gun till I shot the bear, which was a mighty large one. I
killed him dead in his tracks. We got him out and butchered
him, and in a little time started another and killed him, which
now made ten we had killed and we know&rsquo;d we couldn&rsquo;t
pack any more home, as we had only five horses along;
therefore we returned to the camp and salted up all our meat,
to be ready for a start homeward next morning.</p>

<p>The morning came and we packed our horses with the
meat, and had as much as they could possibly carry, and
sure enough cut out for home. It was about thirty miles,
and we reached home the second day. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
had killed in all, up to that time, fifty-eight bears, during
the fall and winter.</p>

<p>As soon as the time came for them to quit their houses
and come out again in the spring, I took a notion to hunt a
little more, and in about one month I had killed forty-seven
more, which made one hundred and five bears I had killed
in less than one year from that time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h2>RICHARD HENRY WILDE.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1789=1847.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Richard Henry Wilde</span> was a native of Ireland but was
brought to this country when a child of nine. His father
died in 1802 and the widowed mother took up her residence
in Augusta, Georgia. He studied law and became a successful
practitioner. He was Attorney-General of the State,
and served also in the Legislature and in Congress. He
spent the years 1834-40 in Europe studying chiefly Italian
literature; in his researches he discovered some old documents
relating to Dante and a portrait of him painted by
Giotto on a wall which had become covered over with
whitewash. On his return to America he settled in New
Orleans and became professor of Law in the University of
Louisiana. He died there of yellow fever.</p>

<p>He began an epic poem, suggested by the life and adventures
of his brother, James Wilde, in the Seminole war.
But it was never finished: all that remains of it now is the
fine lyric, &ldquo;My Life is Like the Summer Rose.&rdquo; This song
was translated by Anthony Barclay into Greek and announced
to be a newly discovered ode of Alcaeus. This
claim was soon disproved by the scholars, and to Mr. Wilde
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
was given his due meed of poetic authorship. It appears
in Stedman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Library of American Literature,&rdquo; as dedicated

<p><span class="smcap">Augustus Baldwin Longstreet</span> was born in Augusta,
Georgia. He became first a lawyer and was elected to the

<h3>NED BRACE AT CHURCH.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[Ned Brace was a real personage, Judge Edmund Bacon, born in
Virginia, 1776, lived in Edgefield, South Carolina, and died there in
1826. He was of very social, hospitable nature, a practical joker,
and, as Dr. Maxcy called him, &ldquo;a perfect Garrick&rdquo; in his conversation.
He was a lawyer of great ability, and when very young and a
student at Augusta he was appointed to deliver an address of welcome
to Washington on his Southern tour. If the following anecdotes
are not true, they might well have been, as Judge Longstreet says.]</p>
</div>

<p>This being the Sabbath, at the usual hour Ned went to
Church, and selected for his morning service one of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
Churches in which the pews are free, and in which the
hymn is given out and sung by the congregation, a half recitative.</p>

<p>Ned entered the Church, in as fast a walk as he could
possibly assume; proceeded about half down the aisle, and
popped himself down in his seat as quick as if he had been
shot. The more thoughtless of the congregation began to
titter, and the graver peeped up slily, but solemnly at him.</p>

<p>The pastor rose, and, before giving out the hymn, observed
that <em>singing</em> was a part of the service, in which he
thought the whole congregation ought to join. Thus saying,
he gave out the first lines of the hymn. As soon as
the tune was raised, Ned struck in, with one of the loudest,
hoarsest, and most discordant voices that ever annoyed a
solemn assembly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would observe,&rdquo; said the preacher, before giving out
the next two lines, &ldquo;that there are some people who have
not the gift of singing; such, of course, are not expected
to sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned took the hint and sang no more; but his entrance
into church, and his entrance into the hymn, had already
dispersed the solemnity of three fifths of the congregation.</p>

<p>As soon as the pastor commenced his sermon, Ned opened
his eyes, threw back his head, dropt his under jaw, and surrendered
himself to the most intense interest. The preacher
was an indifferent one; and by as much as he became dull
and insipid, by so much did Ned become absorbed in his discourse.
And yet it was impossible for the nicest observer
to detect anything in his looks or manner, short of the most
solemn devotion. The effect which his conduct had upon
the congregation, and their subsequent remarks, must be left
to the imagination of the reader. I give but one remark:
&ldquo;Bless that good man who came in the church so quick,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
said a venerable matron as she left the church door, &ldquo;how
he was affected by the <em>sarment</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned went to church no more on that day. About four
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, while he was standing at the tavern
door, a funeral procession passed by, at the foot of which,
and singly, walked one of the smallest men I ever saw. As
soon as he came opposite the door, Ned stepped out and
joined him with great solemnity. The contrast between the
two was ludicrously striking, and the little man&rsquo;s looks and
uneasiness plainly showed that he felt it. However, he soon
became reconciled to it. They proceeded but a little way
before Ned inquired of his companion who was dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Noah Bills,&rdquo; said the little man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan?&rdquo; said Ned, raising his hand to his ear in token of
deafness, and bending his head to the speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Noah Bills,&rdquo; repeated the little man, loud enough
to disturb the two couples immediately before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Noel&rsquo;s Bill!&rdquo; said Ned with mortification and
astonishment. &ldquo;Do the white persons pay such respect to
niggers in Savannah? <em>I</em> sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; So saying, he left
the procession.</p>

<p>The little man was at first considerably nettled; but upon
being left to his own reflections, he got into an uncontrollable
fit of laughter, as did the couple immediately in
advance of him, who overheard Ned&rsquo;s remark. The procession
now exhibited a most mortifying spectacle&mdash;the head
of it in mourning and in tears, and the foot of it convulsed
with laughter.</p>


<h3>A SAGE CONVERSATION.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Georgia Scenes, first edition, 1835.</i>)</p>

<p>[Three old women over their pipes.]</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shad.</i>&mdash;The old man likes a joke yet right well, the
old man does; but he&rsquo;s a mighty good man, and I think he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
prays with greater libity, than most any one of his age I
most ever seed,&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think he does, Mis&rsquo; Reed?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Reed.</i>&mdash;Powerful.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barney.</i>.&mdash;Who did he marry?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shad.</i>&mdash;Why, he married&mdash;stop, I&rsquo;ll tell you directly&mdash;Why,
what does make my old head forget so?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;Well, it seems to me I don&rsquo;t remember
like I used to. Didn&rsquo;t he marry a Ramsbottom?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Reed.</i>&mdash;No. Stay, I&rsquo;ll tell you who he married presently.
Oh, stay! Why I&rsquo;ll tell you who he married! He
married old daddy Johnny Hooer&rsquo;s da&rsquo;ter, Mournin&rsquo;.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shad.</i>&mdash;Why, la! messy on me, so he did!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;Why, did he marry a Hooer?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shad.</i>&mdash;Why, to be sure he did.&mdash;You knew Mournin&rsquo;.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;Oh, mighty well; but I&rsquo;d forgot that
brother Smith married her. I really thought he married a
Ramsbottom.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Reed.</i>&mdash;Oh no, bless your soul, honey, he married
Mournin&rsquo;.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;Well, the law me, I&rsquo;m clear beat!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shad.</i>&mdash;Oh, it&rsquo;s so, you may be sure it is.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;Emph, emph, emph, emph! And brother
Smith married Mournin&rsquo; Hooer! Well, I&rsquo;m clear put out!
Seems to me I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; mighty forgetful somehow.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shad.</i>&mdash;Oh yes, he married Mournin&rsquo;, and I saw her
when she joined society.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;Why, you don&rsquo;t tell me so!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shad.</i>&mdash;Oh, it&rsquo;s the truth. She didn&rsquo;t join till after
she was married, and the church took on mightily about his
marrying one out of society. But after she joined, they all
got satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Reed.</i>&mdash;Why, la! me, the seven stars is &rsquo;way over
here!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
<i>Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;Well, let&rsquo;s light our pipes, and take a short
smoke, and go to bed. How did you come on raisin&rsquo; chickens
this year, Mis&rsquo; Shad?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shad.</i>&mdash;La messy, honey! I have had mighty bad
luck. I had the prettiest pa&rsquo;sel you most ever seed, till the
varment took to killin&rsquo; &rsquo;em.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Reed and Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;The varment!!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shad.</i>&mdash;Oh, dear, yes. The hawk catched a powerful
sight of them; and then the varment took to &rsquo;em, and
nat&rsquo;ly took &rsquo;em fore and aft, bodily, till they left most none
at all hardly. Sucky counted &rsquo;em up t&rsquo;other day, and there
warn&rsquo;t but thirty-nine, she said, countin&rsquo; in the old speckle
hen&rsquo;s chickens that jist come off her nest.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Reed and Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;Humph&mdash;h&mdash;h!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Reed.</i>&mdash;Well, I&rsquo;ve had bad luck, too. Billy&rsquo;s hound-dogs
broke up most all my nests.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;Well, so they did me, Mis&rsquo; Reed. I always
did despise a hound-dog upon the face of yea&rsquo;th.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Reed.</i>&mdash;Oh, they are the bawllinest, squallinest,
thievishest things ever was about one; but Billy will have
&rsquo;em, and I think in my soul his old Troup&rsquo;s the beat of all
creaters I ever seed in all my born days a-suckin&rsquo; o&rsquo; hen&rsquo;s
eggs. He&rsquo;s clean most broke me up entirely.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Shad.</i>&mdash;The lackaday!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Reed.</i>&mdash;And them that was hatched out, some took
to takin&rsquo; the gaps, and some the pip, and one ailment or
other, till they most all died.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;I reckon they must have eat something
didn&rsquo;t agree with them.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Reed.</i>&mdash;No, they didn&rsquo;t, for I fed &rsquo;em every mornin&rsquo;
with my own hand.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barney.</i>&mdash;Well, it&rsquo;s mighty curious!</p>

<p>A short pause ensued, which was broken by Mrs. Barney
with, &ldquo;And brother Smith married Mournin&rsquo; Hooer!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>ROBERT YOUNG HAYNE.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1791=1839.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Robert Young Hayne</span> was born in St. Paul&rsquo;s Parish,
Colleton District, South Carolina, and was educated in
Charleston. He became a lawyer; he served in the war of
1812, and was in the State Legislature from 1814 to 1818.
He was Attorney-General of the United States under President
Monroe, and in 1823 was elected to the Senate. His
most famous speech is that in the debate with Daniel Webster
on the Right of Nullification.</p>

<p>South Carolina passed the ordinance of Nullification in
November, 1832, elected Mr. Hayne governor, and when
President Jackson issued a martial proclamation against
her action, she prepared for war. Mr. Clay&rsquo;s Tariff Compromise
prevented any outbreak.</p>

<p>Mr. Hayne died in Asheville, North Carolina, yet in the
prime of life. See his Life by Paul Hamilton Hayne.</p>

<p class="works">
Speeches.<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Hayne was one of the leaders in the stirring times in
which he lived; the extract following gives an example of
his bold, fearless eloquence, and his power in debate.</p>


<h3>STATE SOVEREIGNTY AND LIBERTY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the Debate with Webster in the Senate, 1830.</i>)</p>

<p>Sir, there have existed, in every age and in every country,
two distinct orders of men&mdash;the <em>lovers of freedom</em> and the
devoted <em>advocates of power</em>.</p>

<p>The same great leading principles, modified only by the
peculiarities of manners, habits, and institutions, divided
parties in the ancient republics, animated the Whigs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
Tories of Great Britain, distinguished in our own times the
Liberals and Ultras of France, and may be traced even in
the bloody struggles of unhappy Spain. Sir, when the gallant
Riego, who devoted himself and all that he possessed
to the liberties of his country, was dragged to the scaffold,
followed by the tears and lamentations of every lover of
freedom throughout the world, he perished amid the deafening
cries of &ldquo;Long live the absolute King!&rdquo; The people
whom I represent, Mr. President, are the descendants of those
who brought with them to this country, as the most precious
of their possessions, &ldquo;an ardent love of liberty&rdquo;; and while
that shall be preserved, they will always be found manfully
struggling against the consolidation of the Government as
the worst of evils.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The Senator from Massachusetts, in denouncing what he
is pleased to call the Carolina doctrine, has attempted to
throw ridicule upon the idea that a State has any constitutional
remedy, by the exercise of its sovereign authority,
against &ldquo;a gross, palpable, and deliberate violation of the
Constitution.&rdquo; He calls it &ldquo;an idle&rdquo; or &ldquo;a ridiculous notion,&rdquo;
or something to that effect, and added, that it would
make the Union a &ldquo;mere rope of sand.&rdquo; Now, sir, as the
gentleman has not condescended to enter into any examination
of the question, and has been satisfied with throwing
the weight of his authority into the scale, I do not deem it
necessary to do more than to throw into the opposite scale
the authority on which South Carolina relies; and there,
for the present, I am perfectly willing to leave the
controversy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The doctrine that it is the right
of a State to judge of the violations of the Constitution on
the part of the Federal Government, and to protect her citizens
from the operations of unconstitutional laws, was held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
by the enlightened citizens of Boston, who assembled in
Faneuil Hall, on the 25th of January, 1809. They state, in
that celebrated memorial, that &ldquo;they looked only to the
State Legislature, which was competent to devise relief
against the unconstitutional acts of the General Government.
That your power (say they) is adequate to that object, is evident
from the organization of the confederacy.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/sl26.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">University of North Carolina.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen, Mr. President, that the South Carolina
doctrine is the Republican doctrine of &rsquo;98,&mdash;that it was
promulgated by the fathers of the faith,&mdash;that it was maintained
by Virginia and Kentucky in the worst of times,&mdash;that
it constituted the very pivot on which the political revolution
of that day turned,&mdash;that it embraces the very principles,
the triumph of which, at that time, saved the Constitution
&ldquo;at its last gasp,&rdquo; and which New England statesmen
were not unwilling to adopt when they believed themselves
to be the victims of unconstitutional legislation. Sir, as to
the doctrine that the Federal Government is the exclusive
judge of the extent as well as the limitations of its power, it
seems to me to be utterly perversive of the sovereignty and
independence of the States. It makes but little difference,
in my estimation, whether Congress or the Supreme Court
are invested with this power. If the Federal Government,
in all, or any, of its departments, is to prescribe the limits of
its own authority, and the States are bound to submit to the
decision, and are not to be allowed to examine and decide
when the barriers of the Constitution shall be overleaped,
this is practically, &ldquo;a government without limitation of
powers.&rdquo; The States are at once reduced to mere petty corporations,
and the people are entirely at your mercy. I have
but one word more to add. In all the efforts that have been
made by South Carolina to resist the unconstitutional laws
which Congress has extended over her, she has kept steadily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
in view the preservation of the Union, by the only means by
which she believes it can be long preserved&mdash;a firm, manly,
and steady resistance against usurpation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Sir, if, acting on these high motives,&mdash;if, animated by that
ardent love of liberty, which has always been the most
prominent trait in the Southern character, we should be
hurried beyond the bounds of a cold and calculating prudence;
who is there, with one noble and generous sentiment
in his bosom, who would not be disposed, in the language of
Burke, to exclaim, &ldquo;You must pardon something to the
spirit of liberty&rdquo;?</p>

<h2>SAM HOUSTON.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1793=1863.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">General Sam Houston</span>, first President of Texas, was born
in Rockbridge County, Virginia, but his widowed mother
removed in his childhood to Tennessee and settled near the
Cherokee Country. Here he was much with the Indians
and was adopted by a chief named Oolooteka, who called
him Coloneh (the Rover).</p>

<p>In 1813 he became a soldier in the Creek war and was
almost fatally wounded at the battle of Tohopeka, or Horse-shoe
Bend, Alabama. In 1818 he decided to study law and
went to Nashville, where he became quite successful as a
lawyer and soon received political honors, being elected
member of Congress in 1823 and governor of Tennessee
in 1827.</p>

<p>In 1829 he left Tennessee for the West, spent three years
in Arkansas among the Cherokees who had emigrated
thither, his old friend Oolooteka being one of them; and in
1832 went to Texas, with which State his after life is connected.
He was made Commander-in-Chief of the Texan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
forces in the struggle for independence against Mexico, and
by the battle of San Jacinto, 1836, he put an end to the war,
and in the same year he was elected first President of the
Republic of Texas. He was elected again in 1841 after
Lamar&rsquo;s administration; and when in 1845 Texas became a
State in the Union, he entered the United States Senate
where he served until 1859. He was governor of Texas
from 1859 to 1861 and then retired to private life. He is
buried at Huntsville.</p>

<p>He was ever a warm friend to the Indians; he was opposed
to secession, and took little interest and no part in the
Confederate war, except by allowing his oldest son to enter
its service.</p>

<p>His life by Rev. Wm. Carey Crane, President of Baylor
University, gives a graphic account of a most interesting
and independent character; and it contains also his literary
remains, consisting of <i>State Papers</i>, <i>Indian Talks</i>, <i>Letters</i>,
and <i>Speeches</i>.</p>


<h3>CAUSE OF THE TEXAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From a Letter to Santa Anna, 1842.</i>)</p>

<p>The people of Texas were invited to migrate to this country
for the purpose of enjoying equal rights and constitutional
liberty. They were promised the shield of the Constitution
of 1824, adopted by Mexico. Confiding in this
pledge, they removed to the country to encounter all the privations
of a wilderness, under the alluring promises of free
institutions. Other reasons operated also. Citizens of the
United States had engaged in the revolution of Mexico, in
1812. They fought gallantly in the achievement of Mexican
independence, and many of them survive, and to this
day occupy the soil which their privations and valor assisted
in achieving. On their removal here, they brought with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
them no aspirations or projects but such as were loyal to the
Constitution of Mexico. They repelled the Indian savages;
they encountered every discomfort; they subdued the wilderness,
and converted into cultivated fields the idle waste
of this now prolific territory. Their courage and enterprise
achieved that which the imbecility of your countrymen had
either neglected, or left for centuries unaccomplished. Their
situation, however, was not disregarded by Mexico, though
she did not, as might have been expected, extend to them a
protecting and fostering care, but viewed them as objects of
cupidity, rapacity, and at last jealousy.</p>

<p>The Texans, enduring the annoyances and oppressions inflicted
upon them, remained faithful to the Constitution of
Mexico. In 1832, when an attempt was made to destroy
that Constitution, and when you, sir, threw yourself forward
as its avowed champion, you were sustained with all
the fidelity and valor that freemen could contribute. On the
avowal of your principles, and in accordance with them,
the people put down the serviles of despotism at Anahuac,
Velasco, and Nacogdoches. They treated the captives of
that struggle with humanity, and sent them to Mexico subject
to your orders. They regarded you as the friend of liberty
and free institutions; they hailed you as a benefactor
of mankind; your name and your actions were lauded, and
the manifestations you had given in behalf of the nation
were themes of satisfaction and delight to the Texan
patriots.</p>

<p>You can well imagine the transition of feeling which ensued
on your accession to power. Your subversion of the
Constitution of 1824, your establishment of centralism, your
conquest of Zacatecas, characterized by every act of violence,
cruelty, and rapine, inflicted upon us the profoundest astonishment.
We realized all the uncertainty of men awakening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
to reality from the unconsciousness of delirium. In succession
came your orders for the Texans to surrender their
private arms. The mask was thrown aside and the monster
of despotism displayed in all the habiliments of loathsome
detestation.</p>

<p>There was presented to Texans the alternative of tamely
crouching to the tyrant&rsquo;s lash, or exalting themselves to the
attributes of freemen. They chose the latter. To chastise
them for their presumption induced your advance upon
Texas, with your boasted veteran army, mustering a force
nearly equal to the whole population of this country at that
time. You besieged and took the Alamo: but under what
circumstances? Not those, surely, which should characterize
a general of the nineteenth century. You assailed one
hundred and fifty men, destitute of every supply requisite
for the defence of that place. Its brave defenders, worn by
vigilance and duty beyond the power of human nature to
sustain, were at length overwhelmed by a force of nine thousand
men, and the place taken. I ask you, sir, what scenes
followed? Were they such as should characterize an able
general, a magnanimous warrior, and the President of a great
nation numbering eight millions of souls? No. Manliness and
generosity would sicken at the recital of the scenes incident
to your success, and humanity itself would blush to class you
among the chivalric spirits of the age of vandalism.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This
you have been pleased to class as in the &ldquo;succession of your
victories;&rdquo; and I presume you would next include the massacre
at Goliad.</p>

<p>Your triumph there, if such you are pleased to term it, was
not the triumph of arms&mdash;it was the success of perfidy.
Fannin and his brave companions had beaten back and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
defied your veteran soldiers. Although outnumbered more than
seven to one, their valiant, hearty, and indomitable courage,
with holy devotion to the cause of freedom, foiled every effort
directed by your general to insure his success by arms.
He had recourse to a flag of truce; and when the surrender
of the little patriot band was secured by the most solemn
treaty stipulations, what were the tragic scenes that ensued
to Mexican perfidy? The conditions of surrender were submitted
to you; and, though you have denied the facts, instead
of restoring them to liberty, according to the capitulation,
you ordered them to be executed contrary to every
pledge given them, contrary to the rules of war, and contrary
to every principle of humanity.</p>


<h3>BATTLE OF SAN JACINTO.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From General Houston&rsquo;s Report to Hon. D.&nbsp;G. Burnet, Provisional President of the
Republic of Texas, April 25, 1836.</i>)</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform you that on the evening of the
eighteenth instant, after a forced march of fifty-five miles,
which was effected in two days and a half, the army arrived
opposite Harrisburg. That evening a courier of the enemy
was taken, from whom I learned that General Santa Anna,
with one division of his choice troops, had marched in the
direction of Lynch&rsquo;s Ferry, on the San Jacinto, burning
Harrisburg as he passed down. The army was ordered to
be in readiness to march early on the next morning. The
main body effected a crossing over Buffalo Bayou, below Harrisburg,
on the morning of the 19th, having left the baggage,
the sick, and a sufficient camp guard in the rear. We continued
the march throughout the night, making but one halt
in the prairie for a short time, and without refreshment.</p>

<p>At daylight we resumed the line of march, and in a short
distance our scouts encountered those of the enemy, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
received information that General Santa Anna was at New
Washington, and would that day take up the line of march
for Anahuac, crossing at Lynch&rsquo;s Ferry. The Texan army
halted within half a mile of the ferry in some timber, and
were engaged in slaughtering beeves, when the army of
Santa Anna was discovered to be approaching in battle
array, having been encamped at Clopper&rsquo;s Point, eight miles
below. Disposition was immediately made of our forces,
and preparation for his reception. He took a position with
his infantry and artillery in the centre, occupying an island
of timber, his cavalry covering the left flank.</p>

<p>The artillery, consisting of one double fortified medium
brass twelve-pounder, then opened on our encampment.
The infantry in column advanced with the design of charging
our lines, but were repulsed by a discharge of grape and
canister from our artillery, consisting of two six-pounders,
[called &ldquo;The Twin Sisters.&rdquo;] The enemy had occupied a
piece of timber within rifle-shot of the left wing of our
army, from which an occasional interchange of small arms
took place between the troops, until the enemy withdrew
to a position on the bank of the San Jacinto, about three-quarters
of a mile from our encampment, and commenced
fortification.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 21st, the enemy
were reinforced by 500 choice troops, under the command of
General Cos, increasing their effective force to upwards of
1,500 men, whilst our aggregate force for the field numbered
783. At half-past three o&rsquo;clock in the evening, I ordered
the officers of the Texan army to parade their respective
commands, having in the meantime ordered the bridge
on the only road communicating with the Brazos, distant
eight miles from our encampment, to be destroyed, thus cutting
off all possibility of escape. Our troops paraded with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
alacrity and spirit, and were anxious for the conflict. Their
conscious disparity in numbers seemed only to increase their
enthusiasm and confidence, and heightened their anxiety for
the conflict.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Col. Sherman, with his regiment, having commenced the
action upon our left wing, the whole line, at the centre and
on the right, advancing in double-quick time, rung the war-cry,
&ldquo;<em>Remember the Alamo!</em>&rdquo; received the enemy&rsquo;s fire, and
advanced within point-blank shot before a piece was
fired from our lines. Our line advanced without a halt,
until they were in possession of the woodland and the
enemy&rsquo;s breastwork, the right wing of Burleson&rsquo;s and
the left wing of Millard&rsquo;s taking possession of the breastwork;
our Artillery having gallantly charged up within
seventy yards of the enemy&rsquo;s cannon, when it was taken
by our troops.</p>

<p>The conflict lasted about eighteen minutes from the time
of close action until we were in possession of the enemy&rsquo;s
encampment, taking one piece of cannon (loaded), four
stands of colors, all their camp equipage, stores, and baggage.
Our cavalry had charged and routed that of the enemy
upon the right, and given pursuit to the fugitives, which
did not cease until they arrived at the bridge which I
have mentioned before&mdash;Captain Karnes, always among the
foremost in danger, commanding the pursuers. The conflict
in the breastwork lasted but a few moments; many of the
troops encountered hand to hand, and not having the advantage
of bayonets on our side, our riflemen used their pieces
as war-clubs, breaking many of them off at the breech.
The rout commenced at half-past four, and the pursuit by
the main army continued until twilight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[In this battle General Houston himself was severely wounded, one
ball shattering his ankle. After this, &ldquo;the battalion of Texan infantry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
was gallantly charged by a Mexican division of infantry, composed
of more than five hundred men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Commander-in-Chief,
observing the peril, dashed between the Texan
and Mexican infantry, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Come on, my brave fellows,
your General leads you.&rsquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The order to fire
was given by Gen. Houston,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a single discharge,
a rush through the smoke, cleaving blows of rifles uplifted
struck down those whom the bullets had not slain. Only thirty-two
of the five hundred Mexicans survived to surrender as prisoners of
war. Gen. Houston&rsquo;s wound in the ankle, meanwhile was bleeding
profusely. His horse was dying, and with difficulty could stagger
over the slain. Still the Commander-in-Chief witnessed every
movement of his army, and as it rolled victoriously over the field,
saw the tide of battle crowning his brave soldiers with unparalleled
success.&rdquo;&mdash;See Crane&rsquo;s Life of Sam Houston.]</p>

<h3>HOW TO DEAL WITH THE INDIANS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From a speech on the Indian Policy of the Government, in the Senate, January, 1855.</i>)</p>

<p>Sir, if the agent appointed by Mr. Polk, who has been
restored by the present Executive&mdash;it is a bright spot in his
Administration, and I commend him for it&mdash;had never been
removed, there would have been peace to this day on the
borders of Texas; but as soon as the Indian agent who was
appointed to succeed him went there, he must forsooth establish
a ranche; he must have a farm. The Indians who had
been settled there from 1843 up to 1849, had been furnished
by the Government of Texas with implements of husbandry,
with seeds of every description, and they were cultivating
their little farms. They were comfortable and independent.
They were living in perfect peace. If you can get Indians
located, and place their wives and children within your
cognizance, you need never expect aggression from them.
It is the Indian who has his wife in security beyond your
reach, who, like the felon wolf, goes to a distance to prey
on some flock, far removed from his den; or like the eagle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
who seeks his prey from the distance, and never from the
flocks about his eyrie.</p>

<p>The agent to whom I have referred lost two oxen from
his ranche where he kept his cattle. He went to the officer
in command of Fort Belknap, got a force from him, and
then marched to those Indians, sixty miles from there, and
told them they must pay for the oxen. They said, &ldquo;We
know nothing about your oxen; our people are here; here
are our women and children; we have not killed them; we
have not stolen them; we have enough to eat; we are happy;
we have raised corn; we have sold corn; we have corn to
sell; we have sold it to your people, and they have paid us
for it, and we are happy.&rdquo; The agent and the military gentlemen
scared off the Indians from the limits of Texas, and
drove them across the Red River to the Wichita Mountains,
taking every horse and animal they had to pay for the two
oxen. This was done by an accredited agent of the Government,
and by an officer who deserved but little credit.
Are such things tolerable, and to be tolerated in the present
age and condition of our Government?</p>

<p>What was the consequence? Those Indians felt themselves
aggrieved. They saw that a new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> had come;
they had had the era of peace and plenty, and now they
were expelled by a different influence. They felt grateful
for the benign effects of the first policy toward them, and
that only exasperated them to a greater extent against the
second; and they began to make incursions, ready to take
vengeance on any white man they might meet in their
neighborhood, and slay whoever they might find. They
made their forays from the opposite side of the Red River,
from the Wichita Mountains, and came like an avalanche
upon our unprotected citizens. There is one fact showing
how your interference with the Indians within her limits
has injured Texas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
Well, sir, there is a remedy for all this, and it is very easy
to apply it; but how are we circumstanced there? Is it
supposed by some that we are deriving great aid from the
army, and that the greatest portion of the disposable forces
of the United States is in Texas, and protecting it? How
can they protect us against the Indians when the cavalry
have not horses which can trot faster than active oxen, and
the infantry dare not go out in any hostile manner for fear
of being shot and scalped! Can they pursue a party who
pounce down on a settlement and take property, and reclaim
that property? Have they ever done it? Did the old rangers
of Texas ever fail to do it, when they were seated on their
Texas ponies? They were men of intelligence and adroitness
in regard to the Indian character and Indian warfare.</p>

<p>Do you think a man fit for such service who has been educated
at West Point Academy, furnished with rich stores
of learning; more educated in the science of war than any
general who fought through the Revolution, and assisted in
achieving our independence? Are you going to take such
gentlemen, and suppose that by intuition they will understand
the Indian character? Or do you suppose they can
track a turkey, or a deer, in the grass of Texas, or could
they track an Indian, or would they know whether they
were tracking a wagon or a carriage? Not at all, sir.</p>

<p>We wish, in the first place, to have men suited to the circumstances.
Give us agents who are capable of following
out their instructions, and who understand the Indian character.
Give us an army, gentlemen, who understand not only
the science of command, but have some notions of extending
justice and protection to the Indian, against the aggression
of the whites, while they protect the whites against
the aggressions from the Indians. Then, and not till then,
will you have peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
How is this to be done? Withdraw your army. Have
five hundred cavalry, if you will; but I would rather have
two hundred and fifty Texas rangers (such as I could raise),
than five hundred of the best cavalry now in the
service.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Cultivate intercourse
with the Indians. Show them that you have comforts to
exchange for their peltries; bring them around you; domesticate
them; familiarize them with civilization. Let them
see that you are rational beings, and they will become rational
in imitation of you; but take no whiskey there at all,
not even for the officers, for fear their generosity would let
it out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I would
have fields around the trading houses. I would encourage
the Indians to cultivate them. Let them see how much it
adds to their comfort, how it insures to their wives and children
abundant subsistence; and then you win the Indian
over to civilization; you charm him, and he becomes a
civilized man.</p>

<p>As an example of Mr. Preston&rsquo;s simpler style and a description

of which still lives and graces the capital of South Carolina&mdash;the
following extract is given. It is from a newspaper
article on the death of Mr. Preston&rsquo;s former law-partner,
Col M&rsquo;Cord, and is a noble tribute to him and to his
distinguished wife, Mrs. Louisa S. M&rsquo;Cord.</p>


<h3>LITERARY SOCIETY IN COLUMBIA, 1825.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Written on the Death of Colonel David J. M&rsquo;Cord, 1855.</i>)</p>

<p>Many will bring tributes of sorrow, of kindness and affection,
and relieve a heaving bosom by uttering words of praise
and commendation; for in truth, during many years he has
been the charm and delight of the society of Columbia, and
of that society, too, when, in the estimation of all who knew
it, it was the rarest aggregation of elegant, intellectual, and
accomplished people that have ever been found assembled
in our village. Thirty years since, amidst the sincere and
unostentatious cordiality which characterized it, at a dinner
party, for example, at Judge De Saussure&rsquo;s, eight or ten of
his favorite associates wanted to do honor to some distinguished
stranger&mdash;for such were never permitted to pass
through the town without a tender of the hospitality of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
venerable and elegant gentleman&mdash;whose prolonged life exhibited
to another generation a pattern of old gentility,
combined with a conscientious and effective performance of
not only the smaller and more graceful duties of life, which
he sweetened and adorned, but also of those graver and
higher tasks which the confidence of his state imposed upon
his talents and learning. To his elegant board naturally
came the best and worthiest of the land. There was found,
of equal age with the judge, that very remarkable man, Dr.
Thomas Cooper, replete with all sorts of knowledge, a living
encyclop&aelig;dia,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Multum ille et terris jactatus et alto</i>&rdquo;&mdash;good-tempered,
joyous, and of a kindly disposition. There
was Judge Nott, who brought into the social circle the keen,
shrewd, and flashing intellect which distinguished him on
the bench. There was Abram Blanding, a man of affairs,
very eminent in his profession of the law, and of most interesting
conversation. There was Professor Robert Henry,
with his elegant, accurate, and classical scholarship. There
were Judges Johnston and Harper, whom we all remember,
and lament, and admire.</p>

<p>These gentlemen and others were called, in the course of
a morning walk of the Chancellor, to meet at dinner, it
might be, Mr. Calhoun, or Captain Basil Hall, or Washington
Irving; and amongst these was sure to be found David
J. M&rsquo;Cord, with his genial vivacity, his multifarious knowledge,
and his inexhaustible store of amusing and apposite
anecdotes. He was the life and the pervading spirit
of the circle,&mdash;in short, a general favorite. He was
then in large practice at the bar, and publishing his
Reports as State Reporter. His frank and fine manners
were rendered the more attractive by an uncommonly
beautiful physiognomy, which gave him the appearance of
great youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
M&rsquo;Cord entered upon his profession in co-partnership with
Henry Junius Nott; and when a year or two subsequently,
this gentleman, following the bent of his inclination for literature,
quitted the profession, Mr. M&rsquo;Cord formed a connection
with W.&nbsp;C. Preston,&mdash;thus introducing this gentleman,
who had then but just come to Columbia, into practice. The
business of the office was extensive, and the connexion continued
until their diverging paths of life led them away
from the profession. The association was cordial and
uninterrupted throughout, whether professional or social;
and the latter did not cease until the grave closed upon
M&rsquo;Cord. While in the law, however, although assiduously
addicted to the study of it, his heart acknowledged
a divided allegiance with literature; which he seemed
to compromise at length by addicting himself to cognate
studies&mdash;of political economy, the jural sciences, and political
ethics.</p>

<p>When he left the bar, and retired from the more strenuous
pursuits of life, he found occupation and delight in these
favorite studies&mdash;stimulated and enhanced by the vigorous
co-operation and warm sympathy of his highly accomplished
wife, who not only participated in the taste for, but shared
in the labors of, these studies&mdash;and amidst these congenial
and participated pursuits the latter years of his life were
passed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As his early
life was amidst struggle and bustle&mdash;the <i>fumum strepitumque</i>
of the public arena&mdash;so his latter years were amidst
the repose of an elegant and lettered retirement, in his
well-cultivated fields and amongst his books. His last
moments were solaced by the tender assiduities of his congenial
helpmate, of his children, and of his old and long-familiar
friends.</p>

<h2>JOHN PENDLETON KENNEDY.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1795=1870.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">John Pendleton Kennedy</span> was born in Baltimore,
Maryland, and received an excellent early education. He
studied law, and was much in public life; he filled a large
place in his native city as a man of culture and a public-spirited
citizen. He served in the State Assembly and in Congress,
and was Secretary of the Navy under President Fillmore
when several important expeditions took place, that of
Perry to Japan, of Lynch to Africa, of Kane to the North
Pole. Kennedy Channel was named in his honor by Dr. Kane.</p>

<p>He made several trips to Europe and while in Paris became
well acquainted with Thackeray. &ldquo;The Virginians&rdquo;
was appearing as a serial, and the printers needed a new chapter.
Thackeray said to Kennedy, &ldquo;I wish you would write
one for me.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Kennedy, &ldquo;so I will if you will
give me the run of the story.&rdquo; And he really wrote the
fourth chapter of Vol. II., describing Warrington&rsquo;s escape
and return home through the region about the Cumberland,
which he knew well.</p>

<p>He drew up the plan of the Peabody Institute, and was
one of the Trustees; to it he bequeathed his library and
manuscripts, the latter not to be published till 1900. He
aided Poe in his early literary life and was always his friend.
He died at Newport, whither he had gone for his health,
and was buried in Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore.

Mr. Kennedy&rsquo;s writings were very popular during his

graphic and excellent pictures of their times, and are true
in their historical details, while his Memoirs of Wirt are
quite as interesting. His &ldquo;Cousin Lucretia&rsquo;s&rdquo; remedy for
chills was actually used by his grandmother, Mrs. Pendleton
of Virginia (see Tuckerman&rsquo;s Life of Kennedy); and Horse-Shoe
Robinson was a real hero of the Revolution whom
Kennedy met in upper South Carolina, 1818.</p>


<h3>A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN IN VIRGINIA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Swallow Barn.</i>)</p>

<p>The master of this lordly domain is Frank Meriwether.
He is now in the meridian of life&mdash;somewhere about forty-five.
Good cheer and an easy temper tell well upon him.
The first has given him a comfortable, portly figure, and the
latter a contemplative turn of mind, which inclines him to
be lazy and philosophical.</p>

<p>He has some right to pride himself on his personal appearance,
for he has a handsome face, with a dark blue eye
and a fine intellectual brow. His head is growing scant of
hair on the crown, which induces him to be somewhat particular
in the management of his locks in that locality, and
these are assuming a decided silvery hue.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to see him when he is going to ride to the
Court House on business occasions. He is then apt to make
his appearance in a coat of blue broad-cloth, astonishingly
glossy, and with an unusual amount of plaited ruffle strutting
through the folds of a Marseilles waistcoat. A worshipful
finish is given to this costume by a large straw hat,
lined with green silk. There is a magisterial fulness in his
garments which betokens condition in the world, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
heavy bunch of seals, suspended by a chain of gold, jingles
as he moves, pronouncing him a man of superfluities.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I am told he keeps the peace as if he commanded a garrison,
and administers justice like a Cadi.</p>

<p>He has some claim to supremacy in this last department;
for during three years he smoked segars in a lawyer&rsquo;s office
in Richmond, which enabled him to obtain a bird&rsquo;s-eye view
of Blackstone and the Revised Code. Besides this, he was
a member of a Law Debating Society, which ate oysters
once a week in a cellar; and he wore, in accordance with
the usage of the most prominent law-students of that
day, six cravats, one over the other, and yellow-topped boots,
by which he was recognized as a blood of the metropolis.
Having in this way qualified himself to assert and maintain
his rights, he came to his estate, upon his arrival at age, a
very model of landed gentlemen. Since that time his avocations
have had a certain literary tincture; for having settled
himself down as a married man, and got rid of his superfluous
foppery, he rambled with wonderful assiduity
through a wilderness of romances, poems, and dissertations,
which are now collected in his library, and, with their battered
blue covers, present a lively type of an army of continentals
at the close of the war, or a hospital of invalids.
These have all at last given way to the newspapers&mdash;a miscellaneous
study very attractive and engrossing to country
gentlemen. This line of study has rendered Meriwether a
most perilous antagonist in the matter of legislative proceedings.</p>

<p>A landed proprietor, with a good house and a host of servants,
is naturally a hospitable man. A guest is one of his
daily wants. A friendly face is a necessary of life, without
which the heart is apt to starve, or a luxury without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
which it grows parsimonious. Men who are isolated from
society by distance, feel these wants by an instinct, and are
grateful for an opportunity to relieve them. In Meriwether
the sentiment goes beyond this. It has, besides, something
dialectic in it. His house is open to everybody, as freely
almost as an inn. But to see him when he has had the good
fortune to pick up an intelligent, educated gentleman, and
particularly one who listens well!&mdash;a respectable, assentatious
stranger!&mdash;All the better if he has been in the Legislature,
and better still, if in Congress. Such a person caught
within the purlieus of Swallow Barn, may set down one
week&rsquo;s entertainment as certain&mdash;inevitable, and as many
more as he likes, the more the merrier. He will know something
of the quality of Meriwether&rsquo;s rhetoric before he is
gone.</p>

<p>Then again, it is very pleasant to see Frank&rsquo;s kind and
considerate bearing towards his servants and dependents.
His slaves appreciate this, and hold him in most affectionate
reverence, and, therefore, are not only contented, but
happy under his dominion.</p>


<h3>HIS WIFE.</h3>

<p>Whilst Frank Meriwether amuses himself with his quiddities,
and floats through life upon the current of his humor,
his dame, my excellent cousin Lucretia, takes charge of the
household affairs, as one who has a reputation to stake upon
her administration. She has made it a perfect science, and
great is her fame in the dispensation thereof!</p>

<p>Those who visited Swallow Barn will long remember the
morning stir, of which the murmurs arose even unto the
chambers, and fell upon the ears of the sleepers; the dry-rubbing
of floors, and even the waxing of the same until
they were like ice;&mdash;and the grinding of coffee-mills;&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
the gibber of ducks and chickens and turkeys; and all the
multitudinous concert of homely sounds. And then, her
breakfasts! I do not wish to be counted extravagant, but a
small regiment might march in upon her without disappointment,
and I would put them for excellence and variety
against anything that ever was served upon platter. Moreover,
all things go like clock-work. She rises with the lark,
and infuses an early vigor into the whole household. And
yet, she is a thin woman to look upon, and a feeble;
with a sallow complexion, and a pair of animated black
eyes which impart a portion of fire to a countenance otherwise
demure from the paths worn across it, in the frequent
travel of a low-country ague. But, although her life has
been somewhat saddened by such visitations, my cousin is
too spirited a woman to give up to them; for she is therapeutical,
and considers herself a full match for any reasonable
tertian in the world. Indeed, I have sometimes thought
that she took more pride in her leechcraft than becomes a
Christian woman; she is even a little vain-glorious. For, to
say nothing of her skill in compounding simples, she has occasionally
brought down upon her head the sober remonstrances
of her husband, by her pertinacious faith in the efficacy of
certain spells in cases of intermittent. But there is no reasoning
against her experience. She can enumerate the cases&mdash;&ldquo;and
men may say what they choose about its being contrary
to reason, and all that;&mdash;it is their way! But seeing
is believing&mdash;nine scoops of water in the hollow of the
hand, from the sycamore spring, for three mornings, before
sunrise, and a cup of strong coffee with lemon-juice, will
break an ague, try it when you will.&rdquo; In short, as Frank
says, &ldquo;Lucretia will die in that creed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am occasionally up early enough to be witness to her
morning regimen, which, to my mind, is rather tyrannically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
enforced against the youngsters of her numerous family,
both white and black. She is in the habit of preparing
some death-routing decoction for them, in a small pitcher,
and administering it to the whole squadron in succession,
who severally swallow the dose with a most ineffectual
effort at repudiation, and gallop off, with faces all rue and
wormwood.</p>

<p>Everything at Swallow Barn, that falls within the superintendence
of my cousin Lucretia is a pattern of industry.
In fact, I consider her the very priestess of the American
system, for, with her, the protection of manufactures is
even more a passion than a principle. Every here and there,
over the estate, may be seen, rising in humble guise above
the shrubbery, the rude chimney of a log cabin, where all
the livelong day, the plaintive moaning of the spinning-wheel
rises fitfully upon the breeze, like the fancied notes of
a hobgoblin, as they are sometimes imitated in the stories
with which we frighten children. In these laboratories the
negro women are employed in preparing yarn for the loom,
from which is produced not only a comfortable supply of
winter clothing for the working people, but some excellent
carpets for the house.</p>

<p>It is refreshing to behold how affectionately vain our good
hostess is of Frank, and what deference she shows to him
in all matters, except those that belong to the home department;
for there she is confessedly and without appeal, the
paramount power. It seems to be a dogma with her, that
he is the very &ldquo;first man in Virginia,&rdquo; an expression which
in this region has grown into an emphatic provincialism.
Frank, in return, is a devout admirer of her accomplishments,
and although he does not pretend to have an ear for
music, he is in raptures at her skill on the harpsichord,
when she plays at night for the children to dance; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
he sometimes sets her to singing &ldquo;The Twins of Latona,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Old Towler,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Rose-Tree in Full Bearing&rdquo;
(she does not study the modern music), for the entertainment
of his company. On these occasions, he stands by
the instrument, and nods his head, as if he comprehended
the airs.</p>


<h3>HOW HORSE-SHOE AND ANDREW CAPTURED FIVE MEN.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Horse-Shoe Robinson, a Tale of the Tory Ascendancy in S.&nbsp;C.</i><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>)</p>

<p>[Mistress Ramsay speaking to Horse-Shoe Robinson:]</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who should come in this morning, just after my husband
had cleverly got away on his horse, but a young cock-a-whoop
ensign, that belongs to Ninety-Six, and four great
Scotchmen with him, all in red coats; they had been out
thieving, I warrant, and were now going home again. And
who but they! Here they were, swaggering all about my
house&mdash;and calling for this&mdash;and calling for that&mdash;as if they
owned the fee-simple of every thing on the plantation. And
it made my blood rise, Mr. Horse-Shoe, to see them run out
in the yard, and catch up my chickens and ducks, and kill as
many as they could string about them&mdash;and I not daring to
say a word: though I did give them a piece of my mind, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is at home with you?&rdquo; inquired the sergeant
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody but my youngest boy, Andrew,&rdquo; answered the
dame. &ldquo;And then, the filthy, toping rioters&mdash;&rdquo; she continued,
exalting her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What arms have you in the house?&rdquo; asked Robinson,
without heeding the dame&rsquo;s rising anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have a rifle, and a horseman&rsquo;s pistol that belongs to
John.&mdash;They must call for drink, too, and turn my house, of
a Sunday morning, into a tavern.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
&ldquo;They took the route towards Ninety-Six, you said, Mistress
Ramsay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;they went straight forward upon the road. But,
look you, Mr. Horse-Shoe, you&rsquo;re not thinking of going
after them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there an old field, about a mile from this, on that
road?&rdquo; inquired the sergeant, still intent upon his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; replied the dame; &ldquo;with the old school-house
upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lop-sided, rickety log-cabin in the middle of the field.
Am I right, good woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And nobody lives in it? It has no door to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t been anybody in it these seven years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the place very well,&rdquo; said the sergeant, very
thoughtfully; &ldquo;there is woods just on this side of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; replied the dame; &ldquo;but what is it you are
thinking about, Mr. Robinson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long before this rain began was it that they quitted
this house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not above fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Ramsay, bring me the rifle and pistol both&mdash;and
the powder-horn and bullets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Mr. Horse-Shoe,&rdquo; answered the dame, as she
turned round to leave the room; &ldquo;but I am sure I can&rsquo;t suspicion
what you mean to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments the woman returned with the weapons,
and gave them to the sergeant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Andy?&rdquo; asked Horse-Shoe.</p>

<p>The hostess went to the door and called her son, and, almost
immediately afterwards, a sturdy boy of about twelve
or fourteen years of age entered the apartment, his clothes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
dripping with rain. He modestly and shyly seated himself on
a chair near the door, with his soaked hat flapping down
over a face full of freckles and not less rife with the expression
of an open, dauntless hardihood of character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like a scrummage, Andy, with them
Scotchmen that stole your mother&rsquo;s chickens this morning?&rdquo;
asked Horse-Shoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agreed,&rdquo; replied the boy, &ldquo;if you will tell me what
to do.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Horse-Shoe now loaded the fire-arms, and having slung
the pouch across his body, he put the pistol into the hands
of the boy; then shouldering his rifle, he and his young ally
left the room. Even on this occasion, serious as it might be
deemed, the sergeant did not depart without giving some
manifestation of that lightheartedness which no difficulties
ever seemed to have the power to conquer. He thrust his
head back into the room, after he had crossed the threshold,
and said with an encouraging laugh, &ldquo;Andy and me will
teach them, Mistress Ramsay, Pat&rsquo;s point of war&mdash;we will
<em>surround</em> the ragamuffins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Andy, my lad,&rdquo; said Horse-Shoe, after he had
mounted Captain Peter, &ldquo;you must get up behind me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. By the
time that his instructions were fully impressed upon the boy,
our adventurous forlorn hope, as it may fitly be called, had
arrived at the place which Horse-Shoe Robinson had designated
for the commencement of active operations. They
had a clear view of the old field, and it afforded them a
strong assurance that the enemy was exactly where they
wished him to be, when they discovered smoke arising from
the chimney of the hovel. Andrew was soon posted behind
a tree, and Robinson only tarried a moment to make
the boy repeat the signals agreed on, in order to ascertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
that he had them correctly in his memory. Being satisfied
from this experiment that the intelligence of his young companion
might be depended upon, he galloped across the intervening
space, and, in a few seconds, abruptly reined up
his steed, in the very doorway of the hut. The party within
was gathered around a fire at the further end, and, in the
corner near the door, were four muskets thrown together
against the wall. To spring from his saddle and thrust
himself one pace inside of the door, was a movement which
the sergeant executed in an instant, shouting at the same
time&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halt! File off right and left to both sides of the house,
and wait orders. I demand the surrender of all here,&rdquo; he said,
as he planted himself between the party and their weapons.
&ldquo;I will shoot down the first man who budges a foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leap to your arms,&rdquo; cried the young officer who commanded
the little party inside of the house. &ldquo;Why do you
stand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do you or your men any harm, young
man,&rdquo; said Robinson, as he brought his rifle to a level, &ldquo;but,
by my father&rsquo;s son, I will not leave one of you to be put
upon a muster-roll if you raise a hand at this moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both parties now stood, for a brief space, eyeing each
other in fearful suspense, during which there was an expression
of doubt and irresolution visible on the countenances
of the soldiers, as they surveyed the broad proportions, and
met the stern glance of the sergeant, whilst the delay, also,
began to raise an apprehension in the mind of Robinson
that his stratagem would be discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I let loose upon them, Captain?&rdquo; said Andrew
Ramsay, now appearing, most unexpectedly to Robinson, at
the door of the hut. &ldquo;Come on, boys!&rdquo; he shouted, as he
turned his face towards the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
&ldquo;Keep them outside of the door&mdash;stand fast,&rdquo; cried the
doughty sergeant, with admirable promptitude, in the new
and sudden posture of his affairs caused by this opportune
appearance of the boy. &ldquo;Sir, you see that it&rsquo;s not worth while
fighting five to one; and I should be sorry to be the death
of any of your brave fellows; so, take my advice, and surrender
to the Continental Congress and this scrap of its
army which I command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During this appeal the sergeant was ably seconded by the
lad outside, who was calling out first on one name, and then
on another, as if in the presence of a troop. The device
succeeded, and the officer within, believing the forbearance
of Robinson to be real, at length said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lower your rifle, sir. In the presence of a superior
force, taken by surprise, and without arms, it is my duty to
save bloodshed. With the promise of fair usage, and the
rights of prisoners of war, I surrender this little foraging
party under my command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the terms agreeable,&rdquo; replied the sergeant.
&ldquo;Never doubt me, sir. Right hand file, advance, and receive
the arms of the prisoners!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, captain,&rdquo; said Andrew, in a conceited tone, as
if it were a mere occasion of merriment; and the lad
quickly entered the house and secured the weapons, retreating
with them some paces from the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said Horse-Shoe to the Ensign, &ldquo;your sword,
and whatever else you mought have about you of the ammunitions
of war!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officer delivered his sword and a pair of pocket pistols.</p>

<p>As Horse-Shoe received these tokens of victory, he asked,
with a lambent smile, and what he intended to be an elegant
and condescending composure, &ldquo;Your name, sir, if I
mought take the freedom?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ensign St. Jermyn, of his Majesty&rsquo;s seventy-first regiment
of light infantry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ensign, your sarvant,&rdquo; added Horse-Shoe, still preserving
this unusual exhibition of politeness. &ldquo;You have
defended your post like an old sodger, although you ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
much beard on your chin; but, seeing you have given
up, you shall be treated like a man who has done his duty.
You will walk out now, and form yourselves in line at the
door. I&rsquo;ll engage my men shall do you no harm; they are
of a marciful breed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the little squad of prisoners submitted to this command,
and came to the door, they were stricken with equal
astonishment and mortification to find, in place of the detachment
of cavalry which they expected to see, nothing
but a man, a boy, and a horse. Their first emotions were
expressed in curses, which were even succeeded by laughter
from one or two of the number. There seemed to be a disposition
on the part of some to resist the authority that now
controlled them; and sundry glances were exchanged,
which indicated a purpose to turn upon their captors.
The sergeant no sooner perceived this, than he halted,
raised his rifle to his breast, and at the same instant, gave
Andrew Ramsay an order to retire a few paces, and to fire
one of the captured pieces at the first man who opened
his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my hand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I find any trouble in taking
you, all five, safe away from this here house, I will thin
your numbers with your own muskets! And that&rsquo;s as good
as if I had sworn to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have my word, sir,&rdquo; said the Ensign. &ldquo;Lead
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your leave, my pretty gentlemen, you will lead and
I&rsquo;ll follow,&rdquo; replied Horse-Shoe. &ldquo;It may be a new piece of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>
drill to you; but the custom is to give the prisoners the
post of honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please, sir,&rdquo; answered the Ensign. &ldquo;Where do
you take us to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will march back by the road you came,&rdquo; said the
sergeant.</p>

<p>Finding the conqueror determined to execute summary
martial law upon the first who should mutiny, the prisoners
submitted, and marched in double file from the hut back towards
Ramsay&rsquo;s&mdash;Horse-Shoe, with Captain Peter&rsquo;s bridle
dangling over his arm, and his gallant young auxiliary Andrew,
laden with double the burden of Robinson Crusoe
(having all the fire-arms packed upon his shoulders), bringing
up the rear. In this order victors and vanquished returned
to David Ramsay&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have brought you your ducks and chickens back,
mistress,&rdquo; said the sergeant, as he halted the prisoners at the
door; &ldquo;and, what&rsquo;s more, I have brought home a young
sodger that&rsquo;s worth his weight in gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven bless my child! my brave boy!&rdquo; cried the mother,
seizing the lad in her arms, and unheeding anything
else in the present perturbation of her feelings. &ldquo;I feared
ill would come of it; but Heaven has preserved him. Did
he behave handsomely, Mr. Robinson? But I am sure he
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little more venturesome, ma&rsquo;am, than I wanted him to
be,&rdquo; replied Horse-Shoe; &ldquo;but he did excellent service.
These are his prisoners, Mistress Ramsay; I should never
have got them if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Andy. In these drumming
and fifing times the babies suck in quarrel with their
mother&rsquo;s milk. Show me another boy in America that&rsquo;s
made more prisoners than there was men to fight them with,
that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>HUGH SWINTON LEGAR&Eacute;.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1797=1843.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hugh Swinton Legar&eacute;</span> (pronounced Le-gr&#275;e&acute;) was born
in Charleston, South Carolina, of Huguenot and Scotch descent.
He was educated at South Carolina College which
he entered at the age of fourteen, and became an excellent
scholar, especially in the languages both ancient and modern.
He studied law, and then completed his education in
the good old way by a course of travel and study in Europe.
His learning is said to have been almost phenomenal: he
was one of the founders of the &ldquo;Southern Review.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On his return from Europe, 1820, he was elected to the
State Legislature: 1830, he was made Attorney-General of
the State; from 1832 to 1836 he was <i>charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires</i> at
Brussels; in 1836 he was elected to Congress, and in 1841
appointed Attorney-General of the United States. He died
in Boston, whither he had gone to take part in the Bunker
Hill Celebration.</p>

<p>Chief-Justice Story said of him: &ldquo;His argumentation was
marked by the closest logic; at the same time he had a
<em>presence</em> in speaking which I have never seen excelled.&rdquo;

<h3>COMMERCE AND WEALTH VS. WAR.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From a speech in the House, 1837.</i>)</p>

<p>A people well clad and well housed will be sure to provide
themselves with all the other comforts of life; and it
is the diffusion of these comforts, and the growing taste for
them, among all classes of society in Europe, it is the desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
of riches, as it is commonly called, that is gradually putting
an end to the destructive and bloody game of war, and reserving
all the resources hitherto wasted by it, for enterprises
of industry and commerce, prosecuted with the fiery spirit
which once vented itself in scenes of peril and carnage.</p>

<p>But, sir, the result of all this is that very inequality of
wealth, that accumulation of vast masses of it in a few
hands, against which we have heard so much said lately, as
if it were something inconsistent with the liberties, the
happiness, and the moral and intellectual improvement of
mankind. Gigantic fortunes are acquired by a few years of
prosperous commerce&mdash;mechanics and manufacturers rival
and surpass the princes of the earth in opulence and splendor.
The face of Europe is changed by this active industry, working
with such mighty instruments, on so great a scale.</p>

<p>I have travelled in parts of the continent which the spirit
of gain, with its usual concomitants, industry and improvement,
has invaded since the peace, at an interval of fifteen
years, and been struck with the revolution that is going on.
There is a singularly beautiful, though rather barren tract
of country between Liege and Spa, where, in 1819, my attention
had been principally attracted by the striking features
of a mountainous region, with here and there a ruin of
the feudal past, and here and there a hovel of some poor
hind,&mdash;the very haunt of the &ldquo;Wild Boar of Ardennes&rdquo; in
the good old times of the House of Burgundy.</p>

<p>I returned to it in 1835, and saw it covered with mills and
factories, begrimed with the smoke and soot of steam-engines;
its romantic beauty deformed, its sylvan solitudes disturbed
and desecrated by the sounds of active industry, and the
busy hum of men. I asked what had brought about so
great a change, and found that the author of it,&mdash;a man
having a more numerous band of retainers and dependents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
than any baron bold of the fourteenth century, and in every
respect more important than many of the sovereign princes
on the other side of the Rhine&mdash;was an English manufacturer,
who had established himself there some twenty years
ago, without much capital, and had effected all this by his
industry and enterprise.</p>

<p>Such, sir, is the spirit of the age; of course, in this young
and wonderfully progressive country, it is more eager and
ardent&mdash;and therefore occasionally extravagant&mdash;than anywhere
else. But it is in vain to resist it. Nay, I believe it
is worse than vain. It is evidently in the order of nature,
and we must take it with all its good and all its evils together.</p>


<h3>DEMOSTHENES&rsquo; COURAGE.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>From the Essay on Demosthenes.</i>]</p>

<p>The charge of effeminacy and want of courage in battle
seems to be considered as better founded. Plutarch admits
it fully. His foppery is matter of ridicule to &AElig;schines,
who, at the same time, in rather a remarkable passage in
his speech on the Crown, gives us some clue to the popular
report as to his deficiency in the military virtues of
antiquity. &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; says he &ldquo;will be there to sympathize
with him? Not they who have been trained with him in
the same gymnasium? No, by Olympian Jove! for, in his
youth, instead of hunting the wild boar and addicting himself
to exercises which give strength and activity to the
body, he was studying the arts that were one day to make
him the scourge of the rich.&rdquo; Those exercises were, in the
system of the Greeks,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. considered
as absolutely indispensable to a liberal education. That of
Demosthenes was certainly neglected by his guardians, and
the probability is that the effeminacy with which he was
reproached meant nothing more than that he had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span>
frequented in youth the palestra and the gymnasium, and that
his bodily training had been sacrificed to his intellectual.</p>

<p>That he possessed moral courage of the most sublime
order is passed all question; but his nerves were weak. If
the tradition that is come down to us in regard to his natural
defects as an orator is not a gross exaggeration, he had
enough to occupy him for years in the correction of them.
But what an idea does it suggest to us of the mighty will,
the indomitable spirit, the decided and unchangeable vocation,
that, in spite of so many impediments, his genius fulfilled
its destiny, and attained at last to the supremacy at
which it aimed from the first! His was that deep love of
ideal beauty, that passionate pursuit of eloquence in the abstract,
that insatiable thirst after perfection in art for its
own sake, without which no man ever produced a masterpiece
of genius. Plutarch, in his usual graphic style, places
him before us as if he were an acquaintance,&mdash;aloof from the
world; immersed in the study of his high calling, with his
brow never unbent from care and thought; severely abstemious
in the midst of dissoluteness and debauchery; a water-drinker
among Greeks; like that other Agonistes, elected
and ordained to struggle, to suffer, and to perish for a people
unworthy of him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;His mighty champion, strong above compare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose drink was only from the liquid brook.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Let any one who has considered the state of manners at
Athens just at the moment of his appearance upon the stage
of public life, imagine what an impression such a phenomenon
must have made upon a people so lost in profligacy and
sensuality of all sorts. What wonder that the unprincipled
though gifted Demades, the very personification of the witty
and reckless libertinism of the age, should deride and scoff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
at this strange man, living as nobody else lived, thinking
as nobody else thought; a prophet, crying from his solitude
of great troubles at hand; the apostle of the past; the
preacher of an impossible restoration; the witness to his
contemporaries that their degeneracy was incorrigible and
their doom hopeless; and that another seal in the book was
broken, and a new era of calamity and downfall opened in
the history of nations.</p>

<p>We have said that the character of Demosthenes might
be divined from his eloquence; and so the character of his
eloquence was a mere emanation of his own. It was the

<h3>A DUKE&rsquo;S OPINIONS OF VIRGINIA, NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA,
AND GEORGIA.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>From a Review of &ldquo;Travels of the Duke of Saxe-Weimar&rdquo; in 1825-6.</i>]</p>

<p>In his journey through Virginia, our traveller visited Mr.
Jefferson, with whom, however, he does not appear to have
been as much struck as he had been with the late Mr.
Adams. The Natural Bridge he pronounces &ldquo;one of the
greatest wonders of nature he ever beheld,&rdquo; albeit he had
seen &ldquo;Vesuvius and the Phlegrean Fields, the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway
in Ireland, the Island of Staffa, and the Falls of Niagara.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Finally&rdquo; (to use a favorite mode of expression of his
own), he is amazed at the profusion of militia titles in Virginia,
which almost persuaded him that he was at the headquarters
of a grand army, and at the aristocratic notions of
some of the gentlemen in the same state, who make no secret
of their taste for primogeniture laws and hereditary nobility.</p>

<p>He passed through North Carolina too rapidly to do anything
like justice to the many remarkable things which that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>
respectable state has to boast of. Accordingly, his observations
are principally confined to the inns where he stopped, the
roads over which he travelled, and the mere exterior of the
towns and villages which the stage-coach traverses in its
route. He is of opinion, from what he saw in that region,
that &ldquo;it would be a good speculation to establish a glass
manufactory in a country, where there is such a want of
glass, and a superabundance of pine-trees and sand.&rdquo; It had
almost escaped us, that he here for the first time made the
acquaintance of a &ldquo;great many large vultures, called buzzards,
the shooting of which is prohibited, as they feed upon
carrion, and contribute in this manner to the salubrity of the
country.&rdquo; This &ldquo;parlous wild-fowl&rdquo; has the honor to attract
the attention of his Highness again in Charleston, where he
informs us that its life is, in like manner, protected by law,
and where it is called from its resemblance to another bird,
the turkey-buzzard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In Columbia,
he became acquainted with most of the distinguished inhabitants,
of whose very kind attentions to him he speaks in
high terms. The following good-natured hint too may not
be altogether useless: &ldquo;At Professor Henry&rsquo;s a very agreeable
society assembled at dinner. At that party I observed
a singular manner which is practiced; the ladies sit down
by themselves at one of the corners of the table. But I broke
the old custom, and glided between them; and no one&rsquo;s
appetite was injured thereby.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Nothing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;can be a stronger
exemplification of the difficulties under which a stranger
labors, in his efforts to acquire a knowledge of a country
new to him, than the perpetual mistakes which our distinguished
traveller commits in his brief notices of Georgia.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Even the complexion of the people of
Georgia displeased him, and, coming from a Court where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
French was not only the fashionable but the common language
of social intercourse, he considers the education of
women neglected, because they are not taught that language
in situations where they might never have occasion to use it.</p>

<p>Dr. Hawks was a distinguished pulpit orator as well as

considered a valuable contribution to the history of the

<p>The book from which we quote, &ldquo;History of North Carolina,&rdquo;

prepared in the intervals of time allowed by &ldquo;a laborious
and responsible profession in a large city:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
he frankly confesses that he would undergo such toil
for no country but North Carolina. She has a claim upon
his filial duty. In her bosom his infancy found protection
and his childhood was nourished. He here lays his humble
offering in her lap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story of the Lost Colony of Roanoke has been called
&ldquo;the tragedy of American colonization.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>THE FIRST INDIAN BAPTISM IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From History of North Carolina.</i>)</p>

<p>The colony [1587] was probably not without its clergyman,
and the faithful Manteo, who was among them, had
by this time become in heart an Englishmen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The mother and kindred of Manteo lived on the island of
Croatan, and thither, very soon, a visit was made by the
faithful Indian and a party of the English, who endeavored,
through the instrumentality of the islanders, to establish
friendly relations with the inhabitants on the main land;
but the effort was in vain. In truth, the greater portion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
the Indians around, manifested implacable ill-will, and had
already murdered one of the assistants, who had incautiously
strayed alone from the settlement on Roanoke island.</p>

<p>On the 13th of August, by direction of Raleigh, given
before leaving England, Manteo was baptized, (being probably
the first native of this continent who ever received
this sacrament at the hands of the English) and was also
called Lord of Roanoke and of Dasamonguepeuk, as the
reward of his fidelity.</p>


<h3>VIRGINIA DARE, THE FIRST ENGLISH CHILD BORN
IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p>A few days after, another event, not without interest in
the little colony, occupied the attention of all; and doubtless
in no small degree enlisted the sympathies of the female
portion of the adventurers. On the 18th of August,
Eleanor, the daughter of Governor White, and wife of Mr.
Dare, one of the assistants, gave birth to a daughter, the
first child born of English parents upon the soil of the
United States. On the Sunday following, in commemoration
of her birth-place, she was baptized by the name of
<span class="smcap">Virginia</span>.</p>


<h3>THE LOST COLONY OF ROANOKE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the Same.</i>)</p>

<p>Governor White remained but thirty-six days in North
Carolina.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Before he left, however,
it seems to have been understood that the colony
should remove from Roanoke Island and settle on the main
land: and as, at his return, he might be at some loss to find
them, it was further agreed that in the event of their departure
during his absence, they should carve on some post
or tree the name of the place whither they had gone; and
if in distress they were to carve above it a cross,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
[This was in 1587.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span>
It was not till the 20th of March, 1590, that Governor
White embarked [at London] in three ships to seek his colony
and his children.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. White found the
island of Roanoke a desert. As he approached he sounded
a signal trumpet, but no answer was heard to disturb the
melancholy stillness that brooded over the deserted spot.
What had become of the wretched colonists? No man may
with certainty say: for all that White found to indicate
their fate was a high post bearing on it the letters CRO,
and at the former site of their village he found a tree which
had been deprived of its bark and bore in well cut characters
the word CROATAN. There was some comfort in
finding no cross carved above the word, but this was all the
comfort the unhappy father and grandfather could find. He
of course hastened back to the fleet, determined instantly to
go to Croatan, but a combination of unpropitious events
defeated his anxious wishes; storms and a deficiency of
food forced the vessels to run for the West Indies for the
purpose of refitting, wintering and returning; but even in
this plan White was disappointed and found himself reluctantly
compelled to run for the western islands and thence
for England. Thus ended the effort to find the lost colony;
they were never heard of. That they went to Croatan,
where the natives were friendly, is almost certain; that
they became gradually incorporated with them is probable
from the testimony of a historian [John Lawson] who lived
in North Carolina and wrote [published] in 1714: &ldquo;The
Hatteras Indians who lived on Roanoke Island or much frequented
it, tell us,&rdquo; (says he) &ldquo;that several of their ancestors
were white people and could talk in a book, as we do;
the truth of which is confirmed by gray eyes being found frequently
amongst these Indians and no others.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHARLES &Eacute;TIENNE ARTHUR GAYARR&Eacute;.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1805= &mdash;&mdash;.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Charles &Eacute;tienne Arthur Gayarr&eacute;</span>, descended from
a family which was among the early settlers of Louisiana,
was born in New Orleans. He was educated at the College
of New Orleans, studied law in Philadelphia, and served
in the State Legislature. In 1835, he was elected to the
United States Senate, but ill-health prevented his taking
the seat, and he spent the eight succeeding years in Europe.
He was afterwards Secretary of State of Louisiana, and in
the seven years of his service he did much to promote an
interest in letters and history, and to establish the State
Library on a firm basis.</p>

<p>He sided with his State in secession, and in 1863 recommended
the emancipation and arming of the slaves. Since
the war, he has spent his time in literary work, and has
written both in English and French, gaining a distinguished
place especially as a historian.</p>

<h3>LOUISIANA IN 1750-1770.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From History of Louisiana, French Domination.</i>)</p>

<p>It was in this year, 1751, that two ships, which were
transporting two hundred regulars to Louisiana, stopped at
Hispaniola. The Jesuits of that island obtained permission
to put on board of those ships, and to send to the Jesuits of
Louisiana, some sugar canes, and some negroes who were
used to the cultivation of this plant. The canes were put
under ground, according to the directions given, on the
plantation of the reverend fathers, which was immediately
above Canal street, on a portion of the space now occupied
by the Second Municipality of the city of New Orleans.
But it seems that the experiment proved abortive, and
it was only in 1796 that the cultivation of the cane, and the
manufacturing of sugar, was successfully introduced in
Louisiana, and demonstrated to be practicable. It was then
that this precious reed was really naturalized in the colony,
and began to be a source of ever-growing wealth, [owing
to the enterprise of Jean &Eacute;tienne de Bor&eacute;].</p>

<p>On board of the same ships, there came sixty girls, who
were transported to Louisiana at the expense of the King.
It was the last emigration of the kind. These girls were
married to such soldiers as had distinguished themselves for
their good conduct, and who, in consideration of their marriage,
were discharged from service. Concessions of land
were made to each happy pair, with one cow and its calf,
one cock and five hens, one gun, one axe, and one spade.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
During the first three years of their settlement, they were
to receive rations of provisions, and a small quantity of
powder, shot, grains and seeds of all sorts.</p>

<p>Such is the humble origin of many of our most respectable
and wealthy families, and well may they be proud of a
social position, which is due to the honest industry and
hereditary virtues of several generations. Whilst some of
patrician extraction, crushed under the weight of vices, or
made inert by sloth, or labor-contemning pride, and degenerating
from pure gold into vile dross, have been swept
away, and have sunk into the dregs and sewers of the commonwealth.
Thus in Louisiana, the high and the low, although
the country has never suffered from any political or
civil convulsions, seem to have, in the course of one century,
frequently exchanged with one another their respective positions,
much to the philosopher&rsquo;s edification.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of September, the intendant Commissary,
Michel de la Rouvilli&egrave;re, made a favorable report on the
state of agriculture in Louisiana. &ldquo;The cultivation of the
wax tree,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;has succeeded admirably. Mr. Dubreuil,
alone, has made six thousand pounds of wax. Others
have obtained as handsome results, in proportion to their
forces; some went to the seashore, where the wax tree grows
wild, in order to use it in its natural state. It is the only
luminary used here by the inhabitants, and it is exported to
other parts of America and to France. We stand in need
of tillers of the ground, and of negroes. The colony prospers
rapidly from its own impulse, and requires only gentle
stimulation. In the last three years, forty-five brick houses
were erected in New Orleans, and several fine new plantations
were established.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The administration of the Marquis of Vaudreuil was long
and fondly remembered in Louisiana, as an epoch of unusual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
brilliancy, but which was followed up by corresponding
gloom. His administration, if small things may be compared
with great ones, was for Louisiana, with regard to
splendor, luxury, military display, and expenses of every
kind, what the reign of Louis XIV. had been for France.
He was a man of patrician birth and high breeding, who
liked to live in a manner worthy of his rank. Remarkable
for his personal graces and comeliness, for the dignity of his
bearing and the fascination of his address, he was fond of
pomp, show, and pleasure; surrounded by a host of brilliant
officers, of whom he was the idol, he loved to keep up a
miniature court, in distant imitation of that of Versailles;
and long after he had departed, old people were fond of
talking of the exquisitely refined manners, of the magnificent
balls, of the splendidly uniformed troops, of the high-born
young officers, and of the many other unparalleled
things they had seen in the days of the <i>Great Marquis</i>.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The inventories made of the property of the twelve gentlemen,
whom the decree of the Spanish tribunal had convicted
of rebellion, afford interesting proofs of the Spartan
simplicity which existed in the colony. Thus the furniture
of the bed-room of Madam Viller&eacute;, who was the wife of
one of the most distinguished citizens of Louisiana, and the
grand-daughter of De Lachaise, who came to the colony in
1723 as ordaining commissary, was described as consisting
of a cypress bedstead, three feet wide by six in length, with
a mattress of corn shucks and one of feathers on the top, a
bolster of corn shucks, and a coarse cotton counterpane or
quilt, manufactured probably by the lady herself, or by her
servants; six chairs of cypress wood, with straw bottoms;
some candlesticks with common wax, the candles made in
the country, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
The rest of the house was not more splendidly furnished,
and the house itself, as described in the inventory, must have
looked very much like one of those modest and unpainted
little wood structures which are, to this day, to be seen in
many parts of the banks of the river Mississippi, and in the
Attakapas and Opelousas parishes. They are the tenements
of our small planters who own only a few slaves, and they
retain the appellation of <em>Maisons d&rsquo;Acadiens, or Acadian
houses</em>.</p>

<p>Viller&eacute;&rsquo;s plantation, situated at the German coast, was
not large, and the whole of his slaves, of both sexes and of
all ages, did not exceed thirty-two. His friends and brother
conspirators, who were among the first gentlemen in the
land, did not live with more ostentation. All the sequestrated
property being sold, it was found that, after having
distributed among the widows and other creditors what they
were entitled to, and after paying the costs of the trial and
inventories, the royal treasury had little or nothing to
receive.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>There were but humble dwellings in Louisiana in 1769,
and he who would have judged of their tenants from their
outward appearance would have thought that they were
occupied by mere peasants, but had he passed their thresholds
he would have been amazed at being welcomed with such
manners as were habitual in the most polished court of
Europe, and entertained by men and women wearing with
the utmost ease and grace the elegant and rich costume of
the reign of Louis XV. There, the powdered head, the silk
and gold flowered coat, the lace and frills, the red-heeled
shoe, the steel handled sword, the silver knee buckles, the
high and courteous bearing of the gentleman, the hoop
petticoat, the brocaded gown, the rich head dress, the stately
bow, the slightly rouged cheeks, the artificially graceful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>
deportment, and the aristocratic features of the lady, formed
a strange contrast with the roughness of surrounding objects.
It struck one with as much astonishment as if diamonds had
been found capriciously set by some unknown hand in one
of the wild trees of the forest, or it reminded the imagination
of those fairy tales in which a princess is found
asleep in a solitude, where none but beasts of prey were
expected to roam.</p>


<h3>THE TREE OF THE DEAD.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From History of Louisiana.</i>)</p>

<p>In a lot situated at the corner of Orleans and Dauphine
streets, in the city of New Orleans, there is a tree which
nobody looks at without curiosity and without wondering
how it came there. For a long time it was the only one of
its kind known in the state, and from its isolated position
it has always been cursed with sterility. It reminds one of
the warm climes of Africa or Asia, and wears the aspect
of a stranger of distinction driven from his native country.
Indeed with its sharp and thin foliage, sighing mournfully
under the blast of one of our November northern winds, it
looks as sorrowful as an exile. Its enormous trunk is
nothing but an agglomeration of knots and bumps, which
each passing year seems to have deposited there as a mark
of age, and as a protection against the blows of time and
of the world.</p>

<p>Inquire for its origin, and every one will tell you that it
has stood there from time immemorial. A sort of vague
but impressive mystery is attached to it, and it is as superstitiously
respected as one of the old oaks of Dodona. Bold
would be the axe that would strike the first blow at that
foreign patriarch; and if it were prostrated to the ground
by a profane hand, what native of the city would not mourn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg&nbsp;241]</a></span>
over its fall, and brand the act as an unnatural and criminal
deed? So, long live the date-tree of Orleans street&mdash;that
time-honored descendant of Asiatic ancestors!</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1727, a French vessel of war landed
at New Orleans a man of haughty mien, who wore the
Turkish dress, and whose whole attendance was a single
servant. He was received by the governor with the highest
distinction, and was conducted by him to a small but comfortable
house with a pretty garden, then existing at the
corner of Orleans and Dauphine streets, and which, from
the circumstance of its being so distant from other dwellings,
might have been called a rural retreat, although situated in
the limits of the city. There the stranger, who was understood
to be a prisoner of state, lived in the greatest seclusion;
and although neither he nor his attendant could be guilty of
indiscretion, because none understood their language, and
although Governor P&eacute;rier severely rebuked the slightest inquiry,
yet it seemed to be the settled conviction in Louisiana,
that the mysterious stranger was a brother of the Sultan, or
some great personage of the Ottoman empire, who had fled
from the anger of the vicegerent of Mohammed, and who
had taken refuge in France.</p>

<p>The Sultan had peremptorily demanded the fugitive,
and the French government, thinking it derogatory to its
dignity to comply with that request, but at the same time
not wishing to expose its friendly relations with the Moslem
monarch, and perhaps desiring for political purposes, to keep
in hostage the important guest it had in its hands, had
recourse to the expedient of answering that he had fled to
Louisiana, which was so distant a country, that it might be
looked upon as the grave, where, as it was suggested, the
fugitive might be suffered to wait in peace for actual death,
without danger or offence to the Sultan. Whether this story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
be true or not is now a manner of so little consequence that it
would not repay the trouble of a strict historical investigation.</p>

<p>The year 1727 was drawing to its close, when on a dark
stormy night the howling and barking of the numerous dogs
in the streets of New Orleans were observed to be fiercer
than usual, and some of that class of individuals who pretend
to know everything, declared that by the vivid flashes
of the lightning, they had seen swiftly and stealthily gliding
toward the residence of the <em>unknown</em> a body of men who
wore the scowling appearance of malefactors and ministers
of blood. There afterwards came also a report that a piratical-looking
Turkish vessel had been hovering a few days
previous in the bay of Barataria. Be it as it may, on the
next morning the house of the stranger was deserted. There
were no traces of mortal struggle to be seen; but in the
garden the earth had been dug, and <em>there</em> was the unmistakable
indication of a recent grave.</p>

<p>Soon, however, all doubts were removed by the finding of
an inscription in Arabic characters, engraved on a marble
tablet, which was subsequently sent to France. It ran thus:
&ldquo;The justice of heaven is satisfied, and the date-tree shall
grow on the traitor&rsquo;s tomb. The sublime Emperor of the
faithful, the supporter of the faith, the omnipotent master
and Sultan of the world, has redeemed his vow. God is
great, and Mohammed is his prophet. Allah!&rdquo; Some
time after this event, a foreign-looking tree was seen to
peep out of the spot where a corpse must have been deposited
in that stormy night, when the rage of the elements
yielded to the pitiless fury of man, and it thus explained in
some degree this part of the inscription, &ldquo;the date-tree
shall grow on the traitor&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who was he, or what had he done, who had provoked
such relentless and far-seeking revenge? Ask Nemesis,&mdash;or,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>
at that hour when evil spirits are allowed to roam over the
earth and magical invocations are made, go and interrogate
the tree of the dead.</p>

<h2>MATTHEW FONTAINE MAURY.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1806=1873.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Matthew Fontaine Maury</span>, the &ldquo;Pathfinder of the Sea,&rdquo;
was born in Spottsylvania County, Virginia, reared in Tennessee,
and entered the Navy in 1825, rising to be lieutenant in
1837. In 1839 he met with an accident which lamed him
for life, and he thenceforward spent his time in study and
investigation of naval subjects. Under the pen-name of
&ldquo;Harry Bluff,&rdquo; he wrote some essays for the &ldquo;Southern
Literary Messenger,&rdquo; which produced great reforms in the
Navy and led to the establishment of the Naval Academy
at Annapolis.</p>

<p>In 1842 he was appointed superintendent of the Hydrographical
Office, and in 1844, of the National Observatory,
at Washington, the latter position including the former.
The observations of winds, currents, and storms, which he
caused to be made during nine years, are embodied in his
&ldquo;Wind and Current Charts;&rdquo; and the system thus begun
was adopted by all European countries and has proven of
immense benefit both to commerce and science.</p>

<p>To him and to Lieutenant John M. Brooke, afterwards
Com. Brooke, C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N., belongs the credit of deep-sea soundings;
and to him we owe the suggestion of the submarine
telegraphic cable across the Atlantic. (<i>See below, letter to
Secretary of the Navy.</i>) Cyrus W. Field said, at a dinner
given in 1858 to celebrate the first cable message across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>
Atlantic,&mdash;&ldquo;Maury furnished the brains, England gave the
money, and I did the work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His &ldquo;Physical Geography of the Sea&rdquo; has been translated
into all the languages of Europe, and caused Humboldt
to say that Maury had founded a new science. His researches
and scientific labors gained him honors and medals
from all scientific societies. His &ldquo;Navigation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Geographies&rdquo;
are in popular use in our schools. His style is irresistibly
attractive, being clear, strong, elegant, and indicative
of truth in the man behind it.</p>

<p>He entered the Confederate service in 1861, and was employed
at first at Richmond and later as naval agent in Europe.
When Lee surrendered, he was in the West Indies on
his way to put in use against Federal vessels in Southern ports
a method of arranging torpedo mines which he had invented.</p>

<p>He then went to Mexico (1865) and took a position in the
Cabinet of the Emperor Maximilian; but the revolution there
(1866) terminated his relations with that government. After
two years in England, he returned to Virginia and in 1868 became
professor of Physics in the Virginia Military Institute.
At this time the University of Cambridge conferred
upon him the degree of LL. D., and the Emperor of the
French invited him to Paris as superintendent of the Imperial
Observatory.</p>

<p>His life has been written in a most engaging style by his
daughter, Mrs. Diana Fontaine Maury Corbin.</p>

<h3>THE GULF STREAM.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Sailing Directions.</i>)</p>

<p>It is not necessary to associate with oceanic currents the
idea that they must of necessity, as on land, run from a
higher to a lower level. So far from this being the case,
some currents of the sea actually run up-hill, while others
run on a level. The Gulf Stream is of the first class. In
a paper read before the National Institute in 1844, I showed
why the bottom of the Gulf Stream ought, theoretically, to
be an inclined plane, running <em>upwards</em>. If the Gulf Stream
be 200 fathoms deep in the Florida Pass, and but 100 fathoms
off Hatteras, it is evident that the bottom would be lifted
100 fathoms within that distance; and therefore, while the
bottom of the Gulf Stream runs up-hill, the top preserves
the water-level, or nearly so; for its banks are of sea-water,
and being in the ocean, are themselves on a water-level.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I have also, on a former occasion, pointed out the fact,
that, inasmuch as the Gulf Stream is a bed of warm water,
lying between banks of cold water&mdash;that as warm water is
lighter than cold&mdash;therefore, the surface of the Gulf Stream
ought, theoretically, to be in the shape of a double inclined
plane, like the roof a house, down which we may expect to
find a shallow surface or roof current, running from the middle
towards either edge of the stream.</p>

<p>The fact that this roof-current does exist has been fully
established&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;by
officers of the navy. Thus, in lowering a boat to try a current,
they found that the boat would invariably be drifted
towards one side or other of the stream, while the vessel
herself was drifted along in the direction of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>This feature of the Gulf Stream throws a gleam of light
upon the <i>locus</i> of the Gulf weed, by proving that its place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>
of growth cannot be on this side (west) of that stream. No
Gulf weed is ever found west of the axis of the Gulf
Stream; and, if we admit the top of the stream to be higher in
the middle than at the edges, it would be difficult to imagine
how the Gulf weed should cross it, or get from one side of
it to the other.</p>

<p>The inference, therefore, would be, that as all the Gulf
weed which is seen about this stream is on its eastern declivity,
the <i>locus</i> of the weed must be somewhere within or
near the borders of the stream, and to the east of the middle.
And this idea is strengthened by the report of Captain
Scott, a most intelligent ship-master, who informs me
that he has seen the Gulf weed growing on the Bahama
Banks.</p>


<h3>DEEP-SEA SOUNDINGS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From a Letter to the Secretary of the Navy, 1854, given in Mrs. Corbin&rsquo;s Life of
Maury.</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>)</p>

<p>The U.&nbsp;S. brig &ldquo;Dolphin,&rdquo; lieutenant commanding O.&nbsp;H.
Berryman, was employed last summer upon special
services connected with this office.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He was directed also to carry along a line of deep-sea
soundings from the shores of Newfoundland to those of Ireland.
The result is highly interesting upon the question of
a submarine telegraph across the Atlantic, and I therefore
beg leave to make it the subject of a special report.</p>

<p>This line of deep-sea sounding seems to be <small>DECISIVE</small> of
the question as to the practicability of a submarine telegraph
between the two continents <em>in so far as the bottom of
the deep sea is concerned</em>. From Newfoundland to Ireland
the distance between the nearest points is about 1600 miles,
and the bottom of the sea between the two places is a plateau
which seems to have been placed there especially for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span>
the purpose of holding the wires of the submarine telegraph,
and of keeping them out of harm&rsquo;s way. It is neither too
deep nor too shallow; yet it is so deep that the wires but
once landed will remain forever beyond the reach of the
anchors of vessels, icebergs, and drifts of any kind, and so
shallow, that they may be readily lodged upon the
bottom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>A wire laid across from either of the above-named places
on this side to the north of the Grand Banks, will rest on
that beautiful plateau to which I have alluded, and where
the waters of the sea appear to be as quiet and as completely
at rest as it is at the bottom of a mill-pond. It is
proper that the reasons should be stated for the inference
that there are no perceptible currents and no abrading
agents at work at the bottom of the sea upon this telegraphic
plateau. I derive this inference from the study of a
physical fact, which I little deemed, when I sought it, had
any such bearings.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Berryman brought up, with &ldquo;Brooke&rsquo;s deep-sea
sounding apparatus,&rdquo; specimens of the bottom from
this plateau. I sent them to Professor Bailey, at West
Point, for examination under his microscope. This he
kindly undertook, and that eminent microscopist was quite
as much surprised to find, as I was to learn, that all these
specimens of deep-sea soundings are filled with microscopic
shells. To use his own words, &ldquo;not a particle of sand or
gravel exists in them.&rdquo; These little shells therefore suggest
the fact that there are no currents at the bottom of the sea
whence they come; that Brooke&rsquo;s lead found them where
they were deposited in their burial-place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Had there been currents at the bottom, they would have
swept and abraded and mingled up with these microscopic
remains the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the bottom of the sea, such as ooze,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
sand, gravel, and other matter; but not a particle of sand
or gravel was found among them. Hence the inference
that these depths of the sea are not disturbed by either
waves or currents. Consequently, a telegraphic wire once
laid there would remain as completely beyond the reach of
accident as it would be if buried in air-tight cases.</p>


<h3>HEROIC DEATH OF LIEUTENANT HERNDON.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Maury&rsquo;s Report, in Mrs. Corbin&rsquo;s Life of Maury.</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>)</p>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">U. S. National Observatory</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>, <i>October 19th, 1857</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;On the 12th day of September last, at sea, the U.&nbsp;S.
mail steamship &ldquo;Central America,&rdquo; with the California
mails, many of the passengers and crew, and a large amount
of treasure on board, foundered in a gale [off Cape Hatteras].
The law requires the vessels of this line to be commanded
by officers of the Navy, and Commander William
Lewis Herndon had this one. He went down with his
ship, leaving a glowing example of devotion to duty, Christian
conduct, and true heroism.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Central America,&rdquo; at the time of her loss, was
bound from Aspinwall, vi&acirc; Havana, to New York. She
had on board, as nearly as has been ascertained, about two
millions in gold, and 474 passengers, besides a crew, all
told, of 101 souls&mdash;total, 575.</p>

<p>She touched at Havana on the 7th September last, and
put to sea again at nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 8th.
The ship was apparently in good order, the time seemed
propitious, and all hands were in fine health and spirits, for
the prospects of a safe and speedy passage home were very
cheering. The breeze was from the trade winds quarter at
N.&nbsp;E.; but at midnight on the 9th it freshened to a gale,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
which continued to increase till the forenoon of Friday,
September 11th, when it blew with great violence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Up to this time the ship behaved admirably; nothing had
occurred worthy of note, or in any way calculated to excite
suspicions of her prowess, until the forenoon of that day,
when it was discovered that she had sprung a leak. The
sea was running high:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the leak
was so large that by 1 P.&nbsp;M. the water had risen high
enough to extinguish the fires on one side and stop the
engine.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Crew and passengers
worked manfully, pumping and baling all Friday afternoon
and night, and when day dawned upon them the violence of
the storm was still increasing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
flag was hoisted union down, that every vessel as she hove
in sight might know they were in distress and wanted
help.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Finally, about noon of Saturday the 12th, the gale began
to abate and the sky to brighten.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At
about 2 P.&nbsp;M. the brig &ldquo;Marine,&rdquo; Captain Burt, of Boston,
bound from the West Indies to New York, heard minute-guns,
and saw the steamer&rsquo;s signals of distress. She ran
down to the sinking ship, and though very much crippled
herself by the gale, promised to lay by.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The steamer&rsquo;s boats were ordered to be lowered&mdash;the &ldquo;Marine&rdquo;
had none that could live in such a sea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
All the women and children were first sent to the brig, and
every one arrived there in safety. Each boat made two
loads to the brig, carrying in all 100 persons.</p>

<p>By this time night was setting in. The brig had drifted
to leeward several miles away from the steamer; and was so
crippled that she could not beat up to her again.</p>

<p>Black&rsquo;s (the boatswain) boat alone returned the second
time. Her gallant crew had been buffeting with the storm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
for two days and nights without rest, and with little or no
food. The boat itself had been badly stove while alongside
with the last load of passengers. She was so much knocked
to pieces as to be really unserviceable, nor could she have
held another person. Still those brave seamen, inspired by
the conduct and true to the trust imposed in them by their
Captain, did not hesitate to leave the brig again, and pull
back through the dark for miles, across an angry sea, that
they might join him in his sinking ship, and take their
chances with the rest.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>As one of the last boats was about to leave the ship, her
commander gave his watch to a passenger with the request
that it might be delivered to his wife. He wished to charge
him with a message for her also, but his utterance was
choked. &ldquo;Tell her&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; Unable to proceed, he bent
down his head and buried his face in his hands for a moment
as if in prayer, for he was a devout man and a Christian.</p>

<p>In that moment, brief as it was, he endured the great agony;
but it was over now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had resolved
to go down with his ship. Calm and collected, he rose up
from that mighty struggle with renewed vigour, and went
with encouraging looks about the duties of the ship as before.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>After the boat which bore Mr. Payne&mdash;to whom Herndon
had entrusted his watch&mdash;had shoved off, the Captain
went to his state-room and put on his uniform;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
then walking out, he took his stand on
the wheel-house, holding on to the iron railing with his left
hand. A rocket was sent off, the ship fetched her last lurch,
and as she went down he uncovered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Just before the steamer went down, a row-boat was heard
approaching. Herndon hailed her; it was the boatswain&rsquo;s
boat, rowed by &ldquo;hard hands and gentle hearts,&rdquo; returning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
from on board the brig to report her disabled condition. If
she came alongside she would be engulfed with the sinking
ship. Herndon ordered her to keep off. She did so, and
was saved. This, as far as I have been able to learn, was his
last order. Forgetful of self, mindful of others, his life was
beautiful to the last, and in his death he has added a new
glory to the annals of the sea.</p>

<p>[A handsome monument to his memory stands in the Parade-ground
of the Naval School at Annapolis.]</p>

<h2>WILLIAM GILMORE SIMMS.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1806=1870.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">William Gilmore Simms</span> was born and reared in
Charleston, South Carolina. His early education was limited;
he was for a while clerk in a drug-store and then he
studied law. But his decided taste for letters soon induced
him to devote his entire time and attention to their cultivation.
He wrote rapidly and voluminously, and produced
poems, novels, dramas, histories, biographies, book-reviews,
editorials,&mdash;in short, all kinds of writing. He was editor
of various journals at different times, and did all he could to
inspire and foster a literary taste in his generation. His
style shows the effect of haste and overwork.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Woodlands, S.&nbsp;C., Home of W. Gilmore Simms.</p>

<p>His novels dealing with Colonial and Revolutionary subjects
are his best work. They give us graphic pictures of
the struggles that our forefathers in the South had with the
wild beasts, swamps, forests, and Indians in Colonial times,
and with these and the British in the Revolutionary period.
They should be read in connection with our early history,
especially the following: <i>Yemassee</i>, (<i>1714, Colonial times</i>);
<i>Partisan</i>, <i>Mellichampe</i>, and <i>Katharine Walton</i>, (<i>forming the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
Revolutionary Trilogy</i>); <i>Eutaw</i>; <i>Scout</i>; <i>Forayers</i>; <i>Woodcraft</i>,
(<i>1775-1783</i>); <i>Wigwam and Cabin</i> (<i>a collection of
short stories</i>).</p>

<p>Some of his poems are well worth reading, especially the
legends of Indian and Colonial life; and the Spirits&rsquo; songs
in &ldquo;Atalantis&rdquo; are very dainty and musical.</p>

<p>He was the friend and helper of his younger fellow-workers
in literature, among whom were notably Paul Hamilton
Hayne and Henry Timrod. At his country home &ldquo;Woodlands&rdquo;
and in Charleston, he dispensed a generous and delightful
hospitality and made welcome his many friends
from North, South, and West. The last few years of his life
were darkened by distress and poverty, in common with his
brethren all over the South; and his heroic struggle against
them reminds us of that of Sir Walter Scott, though far
more dire and pathetic.</p>

native and much-loved city. See Life, by William P. Trent.</p>

<h3>THE DOOM OF OCCONESTOGA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Yemassee.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[Occonestoga, the degenerate son of the Yemassee chief Sanutee,
has been condemned, for befriending the whites, to a fate worse than
death. The <i>totem</i> of his tribe, an arrow branded upon the shoulder,
is to be cut and burnt out by the executioner, Malatchie, and he is to
be declared accursed from his tribe and from their paradise forever,
&ldquo;a slave of Opitchi-Manneyto,&rdquo; the evil spirit.]</p>
</div>

<p>Occonestoga&rsquo;s head sank in despair, as he beheld the unchanging
look of stern resolve with which the unbending
sire regarded him. For a moment he was unmanned; until
a loud shout of derision from the crowd as they beheld the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>
show of his weakness, came to the support of his pride. The
Indian shrinks from humiliation, where he would not shrink
from death; and, as the shout reached his ears, he shouted
back his defiance, raised his head loftily in air, and with the
most perfect composure, commenced singing his song of
death, the song of many victories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherefore sings he his death-song?&rdquo; was the cry from
many voices,&mdash;&ldquo;he is not to die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art the slave of Opitchi-Manneyto,&rdquo; cried Malatchie
to the captive, &ldquo;thou shalt sing no lie of thy
victories in the ear of Yemassee. The slave of Opitchi-Manneyto
has no triumph&rdquo;&mdash;and the words of the song were
effectually drowned, if not silenced, in the tremendous
clamor which they raised about him. It was then that Malatchie
claimed his victim&mdash;the doom had been already given,
but the ceremony of expatriation and outlawry was yet to
follow, and under the direction of the prophet, the various
castes and classes of the nation prepared to take a final
leave of one who could no longer be known among them.
First of all came a band of young marriageable women,
who, wheeling in a circle three times about him, sang
together a wild apostrophe containing a bitter farewell,
which nothing in our language could perfectly embody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go,&mdash;thou hast no wife in Yemassee,&mdash;thou hast given
no lodge to the daughter of Yemassee,&mdash;thou hast slain no
meat for thy children. Thou hast no name&mdash;the women of
Yemassee know thee no more. They know thee no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the final sentence was reverberated from the entire
assembly, &ldquo;They know thee no more, they know thee no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came a number of the ancient men,&mdash;the patriarchs
of the nation, who surrounded him in circular mazes three
several times, singing as they did so a hymn of like import.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
&ldquo;Go&mdash;thou sittest not in the council of Yemassee&mdash;thou
shalt not speak wisdom to the boy that comes. Thou hast
no name in Yemassee&mdash;the fathers of Yemassee, they know
thee no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again the whole assembly cried out, as with one
voice, &ldquo;They know thee no more, they know thee no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were followed by the young warriors, his old associates,
who now, in a solemn band, approached him to go
through a like performance. His eyes were shut as they
came, his blood was chilled in his heart, and the articulated
farewell of their wild chant failed seemingly to reach his
ear. Nothing but the last sentence he heard&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Thou that wast a brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art nothing now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young warriors of Yemassee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They know thee no more.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the crowd cried with them, &ldquo;They know thee no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is no hatchet sharp for Occonestoga?&rdquo; moaned forth
the suffering savage. But his trials were only then begun.
Enoree-Mattee now approached him with the words, with
which, as the representative of the good Manneyto, he renounced
him,&mdash;with which he denied him access to the Indian
heaven, and left him a slave and an outcast, a miserable
wanderer amid the shadows and the swamps, and liable
to all the doom and terrors which come with the service of
Opitchi-Manneyto.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Thou wast the child of Manneyto,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>sung the high priest in a solemn chant, and with a deep-toned
voice that thrilled strangely amid the silence of the
scene,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Thou wast the child of Manneyto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave thee arrows and an eye,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wast the strong son of Manneyto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave thee feathers and a wing,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wast a young brave of Manneyto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave thee scalps and a war-song,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he knows thee no more&mdash;he knows thee no more.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the clustering multitude again gave back the last
line in wild chorus. The prophet continued his chant:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;That Opitchi-Manneyto!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He commands thee for his slave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Yemassee must hear him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear, and give thee for his slave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will take from thee the arrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broad arrow of thy people,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt see no blessed valley,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the plum-groves always bloom&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt hear no songs of valour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the ancient Yemassee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, mother, name, and people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt lose with that broad arrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art lost to the Manneyto,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows thee no more&mdash;he knows thee no more.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The despair of hell was in the face of the victim, and he
howled forth, in a cry of agony that for a moment silenced
the wild chorus of the crowd around, the terrible consciousness
in his mind of that privation which the doom entailed
upon him. Every feature was convulsed with emotion;
and the terrors of Opitchi-Manneyto&rsquo;s dominion seemed already
in strong exercise upon the muscles of his heart, when
Sanutee, the father, silently approached him, and with a
pause of a few moments, stood gazing upon the son from
whom he was to be separated eternally&mdash;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
In a loud and bitter voice he exclaimed, &ldquo;Thy father
knows thee no more,&rdquo;&mdash;and once more came to the ears of
the victim the melancholy chorus of the multitude&mdash;&ldquo;He
knows thee no more, he knows thee no more.&rdquo; Sanutee
turned quickly away as he had spoken; and as if he suffered
more than he was willing to show, the old man rapidly
hastened to the little mound where he had been previously
sitting, his eyes averted from the further spectacle. Occonestoga,
goaded to madness by these several incidents,
shrieked forth the bitterest execrations, until Enoree-Mattee,
preceding Malatchie, again approached. Having given
some directions in an under-tone to the latter, he retired,
leaving the executioner alone with his victim. Malatchie,
then, while all was silence in the crowd,&mdash;a thick silence,
in which even respiration seemed to be suspended,&mdash;proceeded
to his duty; and, lifting the feet of Occonestoga
carefully from the ground, he placed a log under them&mdash;then
addressing him, as he again bared his knife which he
stuck in the tree above his head, he sung&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I take from thee the earth of Yemassee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I take from thee the water of Yemassee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I take from thee the arrow of Yemassee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art no longer a Yemassee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Yemassee knows thee no more.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The Yemassee knows thee no more,&rdquo; cried the multitude,
and their universal shout was deafening upon the ear.
Occonestoga said no word now&mdash;he could offer no resistance
to the unnerving hands of Malatchie, who now bared the
arm more completely of its covering. But his limbs were
convulsed with the spasms of that dreadful terror of the
future which was racking and raging in every pulse of his
heart. He had full faith in the superstitions of his people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
His terrors acknowledged the full horrors of their doom.
A despairing agony which no language could describe had
possession of his soul.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the silence of all indicated the general anxiety;
and Malatchie prepared to seize the knife and perform the
operation, when a confused murmur arose from the crowd
around; the mass gave way and parted, and, rushing
wildly into the area, came Matiwan, his mother, the long
black hair streaming, the features, an astonishing likeness
to his own, convulsed like his; and her action that of one
reckless of all things in the way of the forward progress she
was making to the person of her child. She cried aloud as
she came, with a voice that rang like a sudden death-bell
through the ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you keep a mother from her boy, and he to be
lost to her for ever? Shall she have no parting with the
young brave she bore in her bosom? Away, keep me not
back&mdash;I will look upon him, I will love him. He shall
have the blessing of Matiwan, though the Yemassee and
the Manneyto curse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The victim heard, and a momentary renovation of mental
life, perhaps a renovation of hope, spoke out in the simple
exclamation which fell from his lips:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Matiwan&mdash;oh, mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rushed towards the spot where she heard his appeal,
and thrusting the executioner aside, threw her arms desperately
about his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch him not, Matiwan,&rdquo; was the general cry from the
crowd; &ldquo;touch him not, Matiwan,&mdash;Manneyto knows him
no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Matiwan knows him&mdash;the mother knows her child,
though Manneyto denies him. Oh, boy&mdash;oh, boy, boy, boy.&rdquo;
And she sobbed like an infant on his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thou art come, Matiwan&mdash;thou art come, but wherefore?
To curse, like the father&mdash;to curse, like the Manneyto?&rdquo;
mournfully said the captive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no! Not to curse, not to curse. When did
mother curse the child she bore? Not to curse, but to bless
thee. To bless thee and forgive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear her away,&rdquo; cried the prophet; &ldquo;let Opitchi-Manneyto
have his slave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear her away, Malatchie,&rdquo; cried the crowd, now impatient
for the execution. Malatchie approached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, not yet,&rdquo; appealed the woman. &ldquo;Shall not
the mother say farewell to the child she shall see no more?&rdquo;
and she waved Malatchie back, and in the next instant
drew hastily from the drapery of her dress a small hatchet,
which she had there carefully concealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What wouldst thou do, Matiwan?&rdquo; asked Occonestoga,
as his eye caught the glare of the weapon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save thee, my boy&mdash;save thee for thy mother, Occonestoga&mdash;save
thee for the happy valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldst thou slay me, mother, wouldst strike the
heart of thy son?&rdquo; he asked, with a something of reluctance
to receive death from the hands of a parent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I strike thee but to save thee, my son; since they cannot
take the totem from thee after the life is gone. Turn
away from me thy head&mdash;let me not look upon thine eyes
as I strike, lest my hands grow weak and tremble. Turn
thine eyes away; I will not lose thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes closed, and the fatal instrument, lifted above
her head, was now visible in the sight of all. The executioner
rushed forward to interpose, but he came too late.
The tomahawk was driven deep into the skull, and but a single
sentence from his lips preceded the final insensibility
of the victim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is good, Matiwan, it is good; thou hast saved me;
the death is in my heart.&rdquo; And back he sank as he spoke,
while a shriek of mingled joy and horror from the lips of
the mother announced the success of her effort to defeat the
doom, the most dreadful in the imagination of the Yemassee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not lost, he is not lost. They may not take the
child from his mother. They may not keep him from the
valley of Manneyto. He is free&mdash;he is free.&rdquo; And she
fell back in a deep swoon into the arms of Sanutee, who by
this time had approached. She had defrauded Opitchi-Manneyto
of his victim, for they may not remove the badge
of the nation from any but the living victim.</p>

<h2 class="padding-top: 2em;">ROBERT EDWARD LEE.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1807=1870.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Robert Edward Lee</span> was born at Stratford, Westmoreland
County, Virginia, descended from a long line of illustrious
ancestors. He was educated as a soldier at West
Point, served with great distinction under General Scott in
the Mexican War, and commanded the troops which suppressed
the John Brown Raid in 1859. When his State
seceded in 1861, he resigned his commission of Colonel in
the United States Army, and returned to Virginia. He
was appointed commander-in-chief of the Virginia forces,
and later of the Confederate Army. His course during
the war has elicited the praise and admiration of all military
critics. After the war he quietly turned to the duties
of a citizen. He became president of Washington College,
which is now called in his honor Washington and Lee University.
He stands with Washington a model for young
men, and many monuments in marble and bronze attest the
love and devotion of the South to her great Chief.</p>

<p>General Lee was a soldier and a man who acted rather
than spoke or wrote. When, however, it was his duty to
speak or write, he did it, as he did everything else, excellently,
striving to express in simplest language the right
and proper thing rather than draw attention and admiration
to himself by any effort at grace or beauty of style. Its
simplicity reminds us of Washington.</p>

<h3>GENERAL LEE&rsquo;S LAST ORDER.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Appomattox Court-House, April 10, 1865.</i>)</p>

<p>After four years of arduous service, marked by unsurpassed
courage and fortitude, the Army of Northern Virginia
has been compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers
and resources. I need not tell the survivors of so many
hard-fought battles, who have remained steadfast to the last,
that I have consented to this result from no distrust of them;
but, feeling that valor and devotion could accomplish nothing
that would compensate for the loss that would have
attended the continuation of the contest, I have determined
to avoid the useless sacrifice of those whose past services
have endeared them to their countrymen. By the terms of
the agreement, officers and men can return to their homes,
and remain there until exchanged.</p>

<p>You will take with you <em>the satisfaction that proceeds from
the consciousness of duty faithfully performed</em>; and I earnestly
pray that a merciful God will extend to you his blessing
and protection. With an unceasing admiration of your
constancy and devotion to your country, and a grateful
remembrance of your kind and generous consideration of
myself, I bid you an affectionate farewell.</p>

<h3>LETTER ACCEPTING THE PRESIDENCY OF
WASHINGTON COLLEGE.</h3>

<p class="address">
<span class="smcap">Powhatan County</span>, <i>August 24, 1865</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;I have delayed for some days replying to
your letter of the 5th instant informing me of my election,
by the board of Trustees, to the Presidency of Washington
College, from a desire to give the subject due consideration.
Fully impressed with the responsibilities of the office, I have
feared that I should be unable to discharge its duties to the
satisfaction of the Trustees, or to the benefit of the country.
The proper education of youth requires not only great ability,
but, I fear, more strength than I now possess; for I do
not feel able to undergo the labor of conducting classes in
regular courses of instruction. I could not, therefore, undertake
more than the general administration and supervision
of the institution.</p>

<p>There is another subject which has caused me serious reflection,
and is, I think, worthy of the consideration of the
Board. Being excluded from the terms of amnesty in the
proclamation of the United States of the 29th of May last,
and an object of censure to a portion of the country, I have
thought it probable that my occupation of the position of
president might draw upon the college a feeling of hostility,
and I should therefore cause injury to an institution which
it would be my highest object to advance.</p>

<p>I think it the duty of every citizen, in the present condition
of the country, to do all in his power to aid in the restoration
of peace and harmony, and in no way to oppose
the policy of the State or general Government directed to
that object. It is particularly incumbent on those charged
with the instruction of the young to set them an example of
submission to authority, and I could not consent to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span>
cause of animadversion upon the college. Should you,
however, take a different view, and think that my services,
in the position tendered me by the Board, will be advantageous
to the college and the country, I will yield to your
judgment and accept it; otherwise I must most respectfully
decline the offer.</p>

<p>Begging you to express to the Trustees of the college my
heartfelt gratitude for the honor conferred upon me, and requesting
you to accept my cordial thanks for the kind manner
in which you have communicated its decision, I am,
gentlemen, your most obedient servant,</p>

<h2>JEFFERSON DAVIS.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1808=1889.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Jefferson Davis</span>, President of the Confederate States,
was born in Todd County, Kentucky, but his father removed
to Mississippi soon afterwards, and he was reared
and partly educated in that state. Later he attended
Transylvania University in Kentucky, and in 1824 entered
West Point. He was graduated in 1828 and served seven
years in the army, being stationed in Missouri and Minnesota.
On account of ill-health he resigned in 1835 and
travelled, and then settled on his Mississippi plantation,
&ldquo;Brierfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was elected to Congress in 1845; served in the Mexican
War with great distinction and was injured in eye and
limb at the battle of Buena Vista. He was Secretary of
War in President Pierce&rsquo;s cabinet, and was a Senator when
Mississippi seceded from the Union.</p>

<p>He made his farewell to the Senate in January, 1861, and
returned home where he was at once appointed commander
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span>
of the State troops. But he had been elected president of
the new Confederacy by the Convention at Montgomery,
and he was inaugurated, February 18, 1861. On the change
of the capital from Montgomery to Richmond, he removed
to the latter city and remained there until the war was
ended.</p>

<p>He was imprisoned for two years at Fort Monroe, to be
tried as a traitor to the United States. Being finally released
on bail, he went for his health to England and
Canada; and then he resided in Memphis and at &ldquo;Beauvoir,&rdquo;
Mississippi, which latter place was his home when he died.
This home, &ldquo;Beauvoir,&rdquo; he had arranged to purchase from
Mrs. Dorsey, who was a kind and devoted friend to his
family and had assisted him in his writing; but on her
death in 1879, it was found that she had left a will bequeathing
it to him and to his daughter Varina Anne. He,
like Lee, had always declined the many offers of homes and
incomes made by their devoted and admiring friends.</p>

<p>On him, as President of the Confederacy, seems to have
fallen in some sense the whole odium of the failure of that
cause; and this passage from Winnie Davis&rsquo; &ldquo;An Irish
Knight&rdquo; has a touching application to his case: &ldquo;Thus
died Ireland&rsquo;s true knight, sinking into the grave clothed in
all the bright promise of his youth; never to put on the
sad livery of age; never to feel the hopelessness of those
who live to see the principles for which they suffered trampled
and forgotten by the onward march of new interests
and new men. Perhaps Freedom like some deity of ancient
Greece, loved him too well to let the slurs and contumely of
outrageous fortune dim the bright lustre of his virgin fame.&rdquo;
He is enshrined in the hearts of thousands.</p>

<p>His daughter, Varina Anne, or Winnie, &ldquo;the Child of
the Confederacy,&rdquo; as she is lovingly called, is a writer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>
some ability. She was educated in Europe, and has written
&ldquo;An Irish Knight&rdquo; [story of Robert Emmet], and articles
for magazines. Mrs. Jefferson Davis&rsquo; Life of Mr. Davis is
a work of rare excellence and interest. See also <i>Davis

<p>Mr. Davis&rsquo; writings have a force and dignity of style that
accord well with his character. &ldquo;His orations and addresses
are marked by classical purity, chaste elegance of expression,
a certain nobleness of diction, and a just proportion of sentence
to idea.&rdquo;&mdash;John P. McGuire.</p>


<h3>TRIP TO KENTUCKY AT SEVEN YEARS OF AGE, AND VISIT TO
GENERAL JACKSON.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Autobiography in Mrs. Davis&rsquo; Life of Davis.</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>)</p>

<p>My first tuition was in the usual log-cabin school-house;
though in the summer when I was seven years old, I was
sent on horseback through what was then called &ldquo;The Wilderness&rdquo;&mdash;by
the country of the Choctaw and Chickasaw
nations&mdash;to Kentucky, and was placed in a Catholic institution
then known as St. Thomas, in Washington county,
near the town of Springfield.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When we reached Nashville we
went to the Hermitage. Major Hinds wished to visit his
friend and companion-in-arms, General Jackson. The whole
party was so kindly received that we remained there for
several weeks. During that period I had the opportunity a
boy has to observe a great man&mdash;a stand-point of no small
advantage&mdash;and I have always remembered with warm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg&nbsp;272]</a></span>
affection the kind and tender wife who then presided over
his house.</p>

<p>General Jackson&rsquo;s house at that time was a roomy log-house.
In front of it was a grove of fine forest trees, and
behind it were his cotton and grain fields. I have never
forgotten the unaffected and well-bred courtesy which
caused him to be remarked by court-trained diplomats,
when President of the United States, by reason of his very
impressive bearing and manner.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the many reports that have been made
of his profanity, I remember that he always said grace at
his table, and I never heard him utter an oath. In the same
connection, although he encouraged his adopted son, A.
Jackson, Jr., Howell Hinds, and myself in all contests of
activity, pony-riding included, he would not allow us to
wrestle; for, he said, to allow hands to be put on one
another might lead to a fight. He was always very gentle
and considerate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Our stay with General Jackson was enlivened by the
visits of his neighbors, and we left the Hermitage with
great regret and pursued our journey. In me he inspired
reverence and affection that has remained with me through
my whole life.</p>


<h3>LIFE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>Those who have intimately known the official and personal
life of our Presidents cannot fail to remember how few
have left the office as happy men as when they entered it,
how darkly the shadows gathered around the setting sun,
and how eagerly the multitude would turn to gaze upon
another orb just rising to take its place in the political firmament.</p>

Worn by incessant fatigue, broken in fortune, debarred by
public opinion, prejudice, or tradition, from future employment,
the wisest and best who have filled that office have retired
to private life, to remember rather the failure of their
hopes than the success of their efforts. He must, indeed, be
a self-confident man who could hope to fill the chair of
Washington with satisfaction to himself, with assurance of
receiving on his retirement the meed awarded by the people
to that great man, that he had &ldquo;done enough for life and
for glory,&rdquo; or even feeling that the sacrifice of self had been
compensated by the service rendered to his country.</p>


<h3>FAREWELL TO THE SENATE, 1861, ON THE OCCASION OF
THE SECESSION OF MISSISSIPPI FROM THE UNION.</h3>

<p>I rise, Mr. President, for the purpose of announcing to
the Senate that I have satisfactory evidence that the state of
Mississippi, by a solemn ordinance of her people, in convention
assembled, has declared her separation from the
United States. Under these circumstances, of course, my
functions are terminated here. It has seemed to me proper,
however, that I should appear in the Senate to announce
that fact to my associates, and I will say but very little
more. The occasion does not invite me to go into argument,
and my physical condition would not permit me to do
so, if it were otherwise; and yet it seems to become me to say
something on the part of the State I here represent on an
occasion so solemn as this.</p>

<p>It is known to Senators who have served with me here
that I have for many years advocated, as an essential attribute
of State sovereignty, the right of a State to secede from
the Union. Therefore, if I had not believed there was justifiable
cause, if I had thought that Mississippi was acting
without sufficient provocation, or without an existing necessity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span>
I should still, under my theory of the government, because
of my allegiance to the State of which I am a citizen,
have been bound by her action. I, however, may be permitted
to say that I do think she has justifiable cause, and I
approve of her act. I conferred with her people before
that act was taken, counselled them then that, if the state
of things which they apprehended should exist when their
convention met, they should take the action which they
have now adopted.</p>

<p>I hope none who hear me will confound this expression
of mine with the advocacy of the right of a State to remain
in the Union, and to disregard its constitutional obligations
by the nullification of the law. Such is not my theory.
Nullification and Secession, so often confounded, are, indeed,
antagonistic principles. Nullification is a remedy which it
is sought to apply within the Union, and against the agent
of the States. It is only to be justified when the agent has
violated his constitutional obligations, and a State, assuming
to judge for itself, denies the right of the agent thus to
act, and appeals to the other States of the Union for a
decision; but when the States themselves, and the people of
the States have so acted as to convince us that they will not regard
our constitutional rights, then, and then for the first time,
arises the doctrine of secession in its practical application.</p>

<p>A great man, who now reposes with his fathers, and who
has often been arraigned for a want of fealty to the Union,
advocated the doctrine of nullification because it preserved
the Union. It was because of his deep-seated attachment
to the Union&mdash;his determination to find some remedy for
existing ills short of a severance of the ties which bound
South Carolina to the other States&mdash;that Mr. Calhoun advocated
the doctrine of nullification, which he proclaimed to
be peaceful, to be within the limits of State power, not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span>
disturb the Union, but only to be the means of bringing the
agent before the tribunal of the States for their judgment.</p>

<p>Secession belongs to a different class of remedies. It is
to be justified upon the basis that the States are sovereign.
There was a time when none denied it. I hope the time
may come again when a better comprehension of the theory
of our Government, and the inalienable rights of the people
of the States, will prevent any one from denying that
each State is a sovereign, and thus may reclaim the grants
which it has made to any agent whomsoever.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>In the course of my service here, associated at different
times with a great variety of Senators, I see now around
me some with whom I have served long; there have been
points of collision, but, whatever of offence there has been
to me, I leave here. I carry with me no hostile remembrance.
Whatever offence I have given which has not
been redressed, or for which satisfaction has not been demanded,
I have, Senators, in this hour of our parting, to
offer you my apology for any pain which, in the heat of the
discussion, I have inflicted. I go hence unencumbered by
the remembrance of any injury received, and having discharged
the duty of making the only reparation in my
power for any injury offered.</p>

<p>Mr. President and Senators, having made the announcement
which the occasion seemed to me to require, it only
remains for me to bid you a final adieu.</p>

<h2>EDGAR ALLAN POE.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1809=1849.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Edgar Allan Poe</span> was born in Boston while his parents
were filling a theatrical engagement there. His father&rsquo;s
family was of Baltimore, his grandfather being Gen. David
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>
Poe of the Revolutionary War, and his father, also named
David Poe, having been born and reared in that city. His
mother, whose maiden name was Elizabeth Arnold, was an
English actress of fascinating beauty and manners.</p>

<p>Left an orphan in 1811, Edgar was adopted by Mr. John
Allan, a wealthy merchant of Richmond, and was educated
at private schools and the University of Virginia, and in
1830 he entered West Point. But he got himself dismissed
the next year and devoted himself thereafter to a literary
life. Mr. Allan declining to aid him further, he had a
wretched struggle for existence.</p>

<p>He seems to have gone to Baltimore and made acquaintance
with some of his relatives; and there he won a prize
of $100 by a story, &ldquo;MS. Found in a Bottle,&rdquo; and was
kindly helped by John Pendleton Kennedy. He became
editor of the &ldquo;Southern Literary Messenger,&rdquo; in Richmond,
and was afterward engaged on various other magazines,
writing stories, poems, book-reviews, and paragraphs, in
untiring abundance.</p>

<p>He married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in 1836, and
their life together was in itself ideally happy, like the life
in the Valley of the Many-Coloured Grass; and Mrs. Clemm,
his aunt and mother-in-law, was the good genius who
watched over &ldquo;her two strange children&rdquo; with an unwearying
devotion, deserving the tribute of the love and
gratitude embalmed in his sonnet called &ldquo;Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His engagement with any one magazine rarely lasted
long, and there is much diversity of opinion as to the cause;
some ascribing it to Poe&rsquo;s dissipated, irregular habits and
irritable temper, others to the meagre support of the magazines,
still others to Poe&rsquo;s restless disposition and desire to
establish a periodical of his own. His uncontrolled and
high-strung nature, so sensitive that a single glass of wine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>
or swallow of opium caused temporary insanity, the uncertainty
of his means of subsistence, his wife&rsquo;s frail health
and her death in 1847, were causes sufficient to render unsteady
even a more solid character than Poe seems to have
possessed.</p>

<p>His writings produced a great sensation. When &ldquo;The
Raven&rdquo; was published in 1845, a friend said of its effect in
New York, &ldquo;Everybody has been raven-mad about his last
poem.&rdquo; Mrs. Browning wrote that an acquaintance of hers
who had a bust of Pallas could not bear to look at it. His
fame is as great, or perhaps greater in Europe than in America,
especially in France; and his works have been translated
into French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Russian.</p>

<p>He died in Baltimore from causes never certainly known,
his last almost unconscious days being spent in a hospital;
his dying words were, &ldquo;Lord, help my poor soul.&rdquo; He is
buried in Westminster churchyard, and in 1875 a monument
was erected over his grave by the teachers of Baltimore,
generously aided by Mr. G.&nbsp;W. Childs of Philadelphia. A
memorial to him has been placed in the Metropolitan
Museum, New York, by the actors of the United States.</p>

<p>No poet has been the subject of more conflicting opinions
as to his life, habits, character, and genius, than Poe. The
best lives of him are those by John H. Ingram, an Englishman,
and George E. Woodberry in the American Men of
Letters Series.</p>

<h3>THE RAVEN.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis some visitor,&rdquo; I muttered, &ldquo;tapping at my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Only this, and nothing more.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eagerly I wished the morrow;&mdash;vainly I had sought to borrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my books surcease of sorrow&mdash;sorrow for the lost Lenore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Nameless here for evermore.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">This it is, and nothing more.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I scarce was sure I heard you&rdquo;&mdash;here I opened wide the door;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Darkness there, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg&nbsp;282]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, &ldquo;Lenore.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, &ldquo;Lenore!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Merely this, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;surely that is something at my window lattice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">&rsquo;Tis the wind and nothing more!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;art sure no craven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night&rsquo;s Plutonian shore!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Quoth the raven, &ldquo;Nevermore.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though its answer little meaning&mdash;little relevancy bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br /></span>
<span class="i7">With such name as &ldquo;Nevermore.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing further then he uttered&mdash;not a feather then he fluttered&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I scarcely more than muttered, &ldquo;Other friends have flown before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Then the bird said, &ldquo;Nevermore.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg&nbsp;283]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what it utters is its only stock and store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Of &lsquo;Never&mdash;nevermore.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Meant in croaking &ldquo;Nevermore.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom&rsquo;s core;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the cushion&rsquo;s velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o&rsquo;er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o&rsquo;er,<br /></span>
<span class="i7"><em>She</em> shall press, ah, nevermore!<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!&rdquo;<br /></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Toombs</span> was born at Washington, Georgia, and
studied at the University of Georgia, then under the presidency
of the famous Dr. Moses Waddell; he afterwards attended
Union College, Schenectady, N.&nbsp;Y., and studied law
at the University of Virginia. He settled in his native town
for legal practice and was so successful as to amass a fortune
within a few years. He served in the State Legislature and
in 1845 was elected to Congress. In 1861, being a member
of the United States Senate, he took leave of it in order to
join his State in secession. He was appointed to the Confederate
Cabinet, but soon resigned and became a general in the
field. After the war he was ordered to be captured and held
for trial as a traitor with Jefferson Davis and Alexander H.
Stephens; but he was never taken. He escaped after much
difficulty and many adventures, and went to Cuba and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg&nbsp;286]</a></span>
France: but he returned in 1867 to Georgia and resumed
the practice of law.</p>

<p>He was notoriously the Big Rebel, even after the war, and
refused to take the oath of allegiance: when asked by a
Northern friend why he had never sued for pardon, he said,
&ldquo;Pardon for what? I have not pardoned you all yet.&rdquo; Later
in life he said that he regretted not having re-instated himself
in citizenship and taken part in public affairs. See his
Life, by P.&nbsp;A. Stovall, and by C.&nbsp;C. Jones, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. Toombs&rsquo; speeches in Congress are said to have been
fiery, powerful, and dogmatic. As a lawyer, Chief-Justice
Jackson thus characterizes his style: &ldquo;Concentrated fire was
always his policy. A single sentence would win his case.
A big thought, compressed into small compass, was fatal
to his foe. It is the clear insight of a great mind only that
shapes out truth in words few and simple. Brevity is
power, wherever thought is strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a regular mythology about Toombs at his State
University. The things he said would fill a volume of Sydney
Smith, while the pranks he played would rival the
record of Robin Hood.&rdquo;&mdash;Stovall&rsquo;s Life of Toombs.</p>


<h3>FAREWELL TO THE SENATE, 1861.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Stovall&rsquo;s Life of Toombs.</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>)</p>

<p>Senators, my countrymen have demanded no new government.
They have demanded no new constitution.
The discontented States have demanded nothing but clear,
distinct, constitutional rights, rights older than the Constitution.
What do these rebels demand? First, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
people of the United States shall have an equal right
to emigrate and settle in the Territories with whatever
property (including slaves) they possess. Second, that
property in slaves shall be entitled to the same protection
from the government as any other property (leaving the
State the right to prohibit, protect, or abolish slavery within
its limits). Third, that persons committing crimes against
slave property in one State and flying to another shall be
given up. Fourth, that fugitive slaves shall be surrendered.
Fifth, that Congress shall pass laws for the punishment of
all persons who shall aid and abet invasion and insurrection
in any other State.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>You will not regard confederate obligations; you will
not regard constitutional obligations; you will not regard
your oaths. What, then, am I to do? Am I a freeman?
Is my State a free State? We are freemen; we have rights;
I have stated them. We have wrongs; I have recounted
them. I have demonstrated that the party now coming
into power has declared us outlaws, and is determined to
exclude thousands of millions of our property from the common
territory; that it has declared us under the ban of the
Union, and out of the protection of the laws of the United
States everywhere. They have refused to protect us from invasion
and insurrection by the Federal power, and the Constitution
denies to us, in the Union, the right to raise fleets
and armies for our own defence. All these charges I have
proven by the record; and I put them before the civilized
world and demand the judgment of to-day, of to-morrow, of
distant ages, and of Heaven itself, upon the justice of these
causes. I am content, whatever it be, to peril all in so holy a
cause. We have appealed, time and again, for these constitutional
rights. You have refused them. We appeal again.
Restore us those rights as we had them; as your Court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg&nbsp;288]</a></span>
adjudges them to be; just as our people have said they are.
Redress these flagrant wrongs&mdash;seen of all men&mdash;and it will
restore fraternity, and unity, and peace to us all. Refuse them,
and what then? We shall then ask you, &ldquo;Let us depart in
peace.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Refuse that, and you present us war. We accept
it, and, inscribing upon our banners the glorious words,
&ldquo;Liberty and Equality,&rdquo; we will trust to the blood of the
brave and the God of battles for security and tranquility.</p>

<h2>OCTAVIA WALTON LE VERT.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1810=1877.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Madame Le Vert</span>, as she is usually styled, was born at
Bellevue near Augusta, Georgia, and was reared in Pensacola,
Florida. She was a granddaughter of George Walton,
signer of the Declaration of Independence, and daughter of
George Walton, governor of Florida. She learned languages
easily and conversed well in French, Spanish, and
Italian. LaFayette said of her: &ldquo;A truly wonderful child!
She has been conversing with intelligence and tact in the
purest French. I predict for her a brilliant career.&rdquo; She gave
the name to the capital of Florida, Tallahassee, a Seminole
word meaning &ldquo;beautiful land.&rdquo; She spent several seasons
in Washington; and she wrote such excellent accounts of
the speeches in Congress, that Calhoun, Webster, and Clay
frequently asked her to read to them their own speeches
from her portfolio.</p>

<p>In 1836 she was married to Dr. Henry S. Le Vert of Mobile
and removed to that city. She travelled in Europe in
1853 and 1855, and her delightful journal and letters home
were afterwards arranged and published as &ldquo;Souvenirs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg&nbsp;289]</a></span>
Travel.&rdquo; Their spirit and style make them charming yet,
and they are valuable as pictures of the times.</p>

<p>Her memory is still fragrant as a most gracious and lovely
woman, a brilliant conversationalist, and a queen of society.
It is said of her that her tongue never wounded and that
she never had an enemy.</p>

<h3>TO CADIZ FROM HAVANNA, 1855.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Souvenirs of Travel.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O lovely Spain! renowned, romantic land!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Our last day on board, the good Dominga (our waiting-woman)
awakened us long before the dawn, saying, &ldquo;Come,
Se&ntilde;ora, go with me on deck and see the day arise.&rdquo; We
did so and were charmed with the beautiful scene. At first
the sky was &ldquo;deeply, darkly blue,&rdquo; and the stars were
gleaming with a brightness never seen in more northern regions.
Slowly a gauzy veil seemed wafting over them, and
along the east sprang up, as it were, banners of purple and
rose-color, and the intense azure of the heavens melted into
a soft gray hue. Soon streaks of golden light flashed through
it, and the glorious sun came forth, converting the mirror-like
ocean into a sea of radiance, burnished and glittering
like myriads of gems. And this was morning upon the
Atlantic!</p>

<p>At mid-day there was a cry of <i>tierra! tierra!</i> (land!
land!) which sent a thrill of joy to many hearts. We had
seen none, except the island of Santa Maria (one of the
Azores, near which we passed), since we left the Antilles.
We ran on deck, and in a few moments</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fair Cadiz, rising from the dark blue sea,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span>
was revealed to our longing eyes. Like a great white dove,
with out-spread wings, resting upon the calm waters, appeared
the distant city. Ah! long shall I remember the
delight of that first look upon lovely Cadiz! The day was
exquisite; the air fresh and balmy, and the sea like a smooth
inland lake. Gentle spirits seemed hovering around to welcome
us, while a warm glowing pleasure filled our hearts.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer we approached, domes, spires, and turrets
gradually rising to view, until the entire outline of the
city, with its snow-white houses and green alamedas, was
before us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Cadiz is a very ancient city. It was founded by the Ph&oelig;nicians,
hundreds of years before the building of Rome.
Upon the coat-of-arms of the city is the figure of Hercules,
by whom the inhabitants say it was built. Then came the
dominion of the Moors, and afterwards the Spaniards.
When America was discovered, a golden prosperity beamed
upon Cadiz, which was lost as soon as the Spanish Possessions
in the New World proclaimed themselves free. It is
strictly a commercial place, and has now only a population
of sixty thousand. The city is upon a rocky point of land,
joined to the peninsula by a narrow isthmus. The sea surrounds
it on three sides, beating against the walls, and often
throwing the spray over the ramparts. On the fourth side
it is protected by a strong wall and bridges over the wide
ditch. At night, they are drawn up, thus isolating the town
completely.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Leaving the bay, we plunged into the long rolling billows
of the Atlantic, and bade</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Adieu! fair Cadiz, a long adieu!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>then turning the cape, upon which was once the Ph&oelig;nician
light-house called &ldquo;the Rock of the Sun,&rdquo; we came to St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>
Lucar. There Magellan fitted out the fleet which first circumnavigated
the globe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We
passed the mouth of the Rio Tinto, upon which stands the
convent [La Rabida], where Columbus, an outcast and wanderer,
received charity from the kind prior, who interceded
with Isabella and thus forwarded the plans of the great discoverer.</p>

<h2>LOUISA SUSANNAH M&rsquo;CORD.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1810=1880.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M&rsquo;Cord</span>, daughter of the distinguished statesman,
Langdon Cheves [pron&rsquo;d Cheeves, in one syllable], was born
at Columbia, South Carolina. She was educated in Philadelphia;
and in 1840 she was married to David James
M&rsquo;Cord, a prominent lawyer of Columbia, at one time law-partner
of Wm. C. Preston. They spent much of their
time at their plantation, &ldquo;Langsyne,&rdquo; near Fort Motte on
the Congaree.</p>

<p>She was a woman of strong character and of commanding
intellect as her writings show. Speaking of her home
life, a contemporary says, &ldquo;Mrs. M&rsquo;Cord herself illustrates
her views of female life by her own daily example. She
conducts the hospital on her own large plantation, attends
to the personal wants of the negroes, and on one occasion
perfectly set a fracture of a broken arm. Thoroughly accomplished
in the modern languages of Europe, she employs
her leisure in the education of her children.&rdquo; See under

<h3>WOMAN&rsquo;S DUTY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Enfranchisement of Woman, in &ldquo;Southern Quarterly Review,&rdquo; April, 1852.</i>)</p>

<p>In every error there is its shadow of truth. Error is but
truth turned awry, or looked at through a wrong medium.
As the straightest rod will, in appearance, curve when one
half of it is placed under water, so God&rsquo;s truths, leaning
down to earth, are often distorted to our view. Woman&rsquo;s
condition certainly admits of improvement, (but when have
the strong forgotten to oppress the weak?)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Here, as in all other improvements, the good must be brought
about by working with, not against&mdash;by seconding, not opposing&mdash;Nature&rsquo;s
laws. Woman, seeking as a woman, may
raise her position,&mdash;seeking as a man, we repeat, she but degrades
it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Each can labour, each can strive, lovingly and earnestly,
in her own sphere. &ldquo;Life is real! Life is earnest!&rdquo; Not
less for her than for man. She has no right to bury her
talent beneath silks or ribands, frippery or flowers; nor yet
has she the right, because she fancies not her task, to grasp
at another&rsquo;s, which is, or which she imagines is, easier. This
is baby play. &ldquo;Life is real! Life is earnest!&rdquo; Let woman
so read it&mdash;let woman so learn it&mdash;and she has no need to
make her influence felt by a stump speech, or a vote at the
polls; she has no need for the exercise of her intellect (and
woman, we grant, may have a great, a longing, a hungering
intellect, equal to man&rsquo;s) to be gratified with a seat in Congress,
or a scuffle for the ambiguous honour of the Presidency.</p>

<p>Even at her own fire-side, may she find duties enough,
cares enough, troubles enough, thought enough, wisdom
enough, to fit a martyr for the stake, a philosopher for life,
or a saint for heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>
There are, there have been, and there will be, in every
age, great hero-souls in woman&rsquo;s form, as well as man&rsquo;s. It
imports little whether history notes them. The hero-soul
aims at its certain duty, heroically meeting it, whether glory
or shame, worship or contumely, follow its accomplishment.
Laud and merit is due to such performance. <em>Fulfill</em> thy destiny;
<em>oppose</em> it not. Herein lies thy track. Keep it. Nature&rsquo;s
sign-posts are within thee, and it were well for thee
to learn to read them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Many women&mdash;even, we grant, the majority of women&mdash;throw
themselves away upon follies. So, however, do men;
and this, perhaps, as a necessary consequence, for woman is
the mother of the man. Woman has allowed herself to be,
alternately, made the toy and the slave of man; but this
rather through her folly than her nature. Not wholly <em>her</em>
folly, either. <em>Her</em> folly and <em>man&rsquo;s</em> folly have made the vices
and the punishment of both.</p>

<p>Woman has certainly not her true place, and this place
she as certainly should seek to gain. We have said that
every error has its shadow of truth, and, so far, the [Woman&rsquo;s
Rights] conventionists are right. But, alas! how wide
astray are they groping from their goal! Woman has not
her true place, because she&mdash;because man&mdash;has not yet learned
the full extent and importance of her mission. These innovators
would seek to restore, by driving her entirely from
that mission; as though some unlucky pedestrian, shoved
from the security of the side-walk, should in his consternation
seek to remedy matters, by rushing into the thickest
thoroughfare of hoofs and wheels. Woman will reach the
greatest height of which she is capable&mdash;the greatest, perhaps,
of which humanity is capable&mdash;not by becoming man, but
by becoming, more than ever, woman. By perfecting herself,
she perfects mankind.</p>

<h2>JOSEPH G. BALDWIN.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>ca. 1811=1864.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Joseph G. Baldwin</span> was born in Virginia but early removed
to Sumter County, Alabama, and was a jurist and
writer of much influence and popularity in that State. He
removed later to California, where in 1857 he became judge
of the Supreme Court and in 1863 Chief-Justice of the State.
His writings are mainly clever and humorous sketches of
the bar and of the communities in which he practised. He
said the &ldquo;flush times&rdquo; of Alabama did not compare in any
degree with those of California which he described in an
article to the &ldquo;Southern Literary Messenger.&rdquo; His &ldquo;Party
Leaders&rdquo; are able papers on Jefferson, Hamilton, Jackson,
Clay, and John Randolph.</p>

<h3>VIRGINIANS IN A NEW COUNTRY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Flush Times in Alabama and Mississippi, published in &ldquo;Southern Literary
Messenger.&rdquo;</i>)</p>

<p>The disposition to be proud and vain of one&rsquo;s country,
and to boast of it, is a natural feeling; but, with a Virginian,
it is a passion. It inheres in him even as the flavor of a York
river oyster in that bivalve, and no distance of deportation,
and no trimmings of a gracious prosperity, and no pickling
in the sharp acids of adversity, can destroy it. It is a part of
the Virginia character&mdash;just as the flavor is a distinctive
part of the oyster&mdash;&ldquo;which cannot, save by annihilating,
die.&rdquo; It is no use talking about it&mdash;the thing may be right,
or wrong;&mdash;like Falstaff&rsquo;s victims at Gadshill, it is past
praying for: it is a sort of cocoa grass that has got into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span>
soil, and has so matted over it, and so <em>fibred</em> through it, as
to have become a part of it; at least there is no telling which
is the grass and which the soil; and certainly it is useless
labor to try to root it out. You may destroy the soil, but
you can&rsquo;t root out the grass.</p>

<p>Patriotism with the Virginian is a noun personal. It is
the Virginian himself and something over. He loves Virginia
<i>per se</i> and <i>propter se</i>: he loves her for herself and for
himself&mdash;because <em>she is</em> Virginia, and&mdash;everything else beside.
He loves to talk about her: out of the abundance of
the heart the mouth speaketh. It makes no odds where he
goes, he carries Virginia with him; not in the entirety always&mdash;but
the little spot he comes from is Virginia&mdash;as
Swedenborg says the smallest part of the brain is an abridgment
of all of it. &ldquo;<i>C&oelig;lum non animum mutant qui trans
mare currunt</i>,&rdquo; was made for a Virginian. He never gets
acclimated elsewhere; he never loses citizenship to the old
Home. The right of expatriation is a pure abstraction to
him. He may breathe in Alabama, but he lives in Virginia.
His treasure is there and his heart also. If he looks at the
Delta of the Mississippi, it reminds him of James River
&ldquo;low grounds;&rdquo; if he sees the vast prairies of Texas, it is
a memorial of the meadows of the Valley. Richmond is
the centre of attraction, the <i>d&eacute;p&ocirc;t</i> of all that is grand, great,
good, and glorious. &ldquo;It is the Kentucky of a place,&rdquo; which
the preacher described Heaven to be to the Kentucky congregation.</p>

<p>Those who came many years ago from the borough towns,
especially from the vicinity of Williamsburg, exceed, in attachment
to their birthplace, if possible, the <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> from
the metropolis. It is refreshing in these coster monger
times, to hear them speak of it;&mdash;they remember it when
the old burg was the seat of fashion, taste, refinement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>
hospitality, wealth, wit, and all social graces: when genius
threw its spell over the public assemblages and illumined
the halls of justice, and when beauty brightened the social
hour with her unmatched and matchless brilliancy.</p>

<h2>ALEXANDER HAMILTON STEPHENS.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1812=1883.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Hamilton Stephens</span> was born near Crawfordville,
Georgia, and received an early and excellent education
in his father&rsquo;s private school and at the University of
Georgia. The cost of his tuition here was advanced by
some friends, and he repaid it as soon as he began to earn
money. He taught for a year in the family of Dr. Le Conte,
father of the distinguished scientists, John and Joseph Le
Conte, now of the University of California.</p>

<p>He pursued his law studies alone and passed an unusually
brilliant examination. He was elected to the State Legislature
in 1836, and to Congress in 1843, where he served until
1858. He then retired to country life at his home, &ldquo;Liberty
Hall.&rdquo; But in 1861 he was elected Vice-President of
the Confederate States. After the war he was made prisoner
and confined for some months at Fort Warren near
Boston. He spent several years in literary work and established
a newspaper at Atlanta, called the &ldquo;Sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was of small stature and delicate health, and met
with one or two severe accidents. His career is a wonderful
illustration of the power of the mind over the body. An
amusing incident is told of him in regard to his size. He
was attending a political convention in Charleston as one
of the chief delegates; and one evening, with several other
prominent men, he was on the porch of the hotel lying on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg&nbsp;297]</a></span>
bench, talking with his companions who were standing
about him. The hotel-keeper coming out saw the gentlemen
standing, and bustling up, said, &ldquo;Get up, my son, and
let these gentlemen be seated.&rdquo; Mr. Stephens at once arose
and his friends burst out laughing; they explained the situation
to the hotel-keeper who was profuse in his apologies.</p>

<p>An instance of his remarkable bravery is the affair with
Judge Cone. This gentleman considered himself insulted by
a remark of Mr. Stephens and demanded a retraction. After
accepting an explanation, he still insisted on a retraction,
and Mr. Stephens refused to make it. Judge Cone, a tall
and powerful man, then drew a knife on him and holding
him down on the floor, cried out, &ldquo;Retract, or I&rsquo;ll cut you
to pieces.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Never!</em>&rdquo; answered Stephens, &ldquo;<em>cut!</em>&rdquo; and
caught the descending knife in his right hand. Friends interposed;
Judge Cone apologized, and they afterwards became
reconciled.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephens was elected to the United States Senate,
1874 and 1876: he was governor of Georgia when he died.

<h3>LAWS OF GOVERNMENT.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From History of the United States.</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>)</p>

<p>The chief end of all States, or the &ldquo;<i>Esprit des Lois</i>,&rdquo; as
Montesquieu maintains, should be the security to each member
of the community of all &ldquo;those absolute rights which
are vested in them by the immutable laws of nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>
Many writers maintain that the individuals upon entering
into society, give up or surrender a portion of their natural
rights. This seems to be a manifest error. No person has
any natural right whatever to hurt or injure another. The
object of society and government is to prevent and redress
injuries of this sort; for, in a state of nature, without a restraining
power of government, the strong would viciously
impose upon the weak.</p>

<p>Another erroneous dogma pretty generally taught is, that
the object of governments should be to confer the greatest
benefit upon the greatest number of its constituent members.
The true doctrine is, the object should be to confer the greatest
possible good upon every member, without any detriment
or injury to a single one.</p>

Foote, and Clemens, and Douglas.</p>

<p>After the carriage of the motion of Mr. Mangum to proceed
to the consideration of the order of the day, Mr. Clay
folds his papers and puts them in his desk, and after the
business is announced, rises gracefully and majestically. Instantaneously
there is general applause, which Mr. Clay seems
not to notice. The noise within is heard without, and the great
crowd raised such a shout that Mr. Clay had to pause until
the officers went out and cleared all the entrances, and then
he began. He spoke on that day two hours and fifteen minutes.
The speech was reported in the <i>Globe</i> word for word
as he uttered it. I never saw such a report before. His
voice was good, his enunciation clear and distinct, his action
firm, his strength far surpassing my expectation. He had
the riveted gaze of the multitude the whole time. When
he concluded, an immense throng of friends, both men and
women came up to congratulate and to <em>kiss</em> him.</p>

<p><i>March 31st.</i>&mdash;The Angel of Death has just passed by,

race is ended. His restless and fiery spirit sleeps in that
deep and long repose which awaits all the living. He died
this morning about seven o&rsquo;clock. Peace to his ashes! His
name will long be remembered in the history of this country.
He has closed his career at a most eventful period of
that history, and perhaps it is most fortunate for his fame
that he died just at this time.</p>


<h3>TRUE COURAGE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From a Speech, 1855.</i>)</p>

<p>I am afraid of nothing on earth, or above the earth, or
under the earth, but to do wrong. The path of duty I shall
endeavor to travel, fearing no evil, and dreading no consequences.
I would rather be defeated in a good cause than
to triumph in a bad one. I would not give a fig for a man
who would shrink from the discharge of duty for fear of
defeat.</p>

<p>The story of the Indian Chief, Red Eagle, or Weatherford,
is one of the most interesting traditions of our country.
Judge Meek&rsquo;s writings teem with the romantic and
marvellous incidents of the early history of Alabama, such
as De Soto&rsquo;s march to the Mississippi, the Battle of Mauville
and defeat of the great Indian King, Tuscaloosa, or
Black Warrior, the Canoe-Fight of Dale, or Sam Thlucco,
as the Indians called him (&ldquo;Big Sam&rdquo;), and the attack on
Fort Mims.</p>


<h3>RED EAGLE, OR WEATHERFORD.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Romantic Passages in South-Western History.</i>)</p>

<p>The battle of Tohopeka put an end to the hopes of
Weatherford. This village was situated on a peninsula,
within the &ldquo;horse-shoe bend&rdquo; of the Tallapoosa. Here
twelve hundred warriors&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had
fortified themselves for a desperate struggle, assured by their
prophets that the Master of Breath would now interpose in
their favor. Across the neck of land, three hundred and
fifty yards wide, that leads into the peninsula, they had constructed
powerful breastworks of hewn logs, eight or ten
feet high, and pierced with double rows of port-holes, from
which they could fire with perfect security. The selection
of this spot and the character of its defence did great credit
to the military genius of Weatherford,&mdash;and his eloquence,
more than usually persuasive and inspiriting, filled his devoted
followers with a courage strangely compounded of
fanaticism and despair.</p>

<p>At an early hour in the morning, General Coffee&rsquo;s command
having crossed the river and encircled the bend so as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg&nbsp;303]</a></span>
to cut off all escape, General Jackson opened his artillery
upon the breastworks, and having but in part demolished
them, ordered forward the thirty-ninth regiment to carry the
place by storm. The van was gallantly led by Col. Williams,
Col. Bunch, Lieut.-Col. Benton, and Maj. Montgomery.
Amidst a most destructive fire, they pressed to the
breastworks, and desperately struggled for the command of
the port-holes. But Maj. Montgomery, impatient at the delay,
cried out to his men to follow him, and leaped upon the
wall in face of the deadliest fire. For an instant he waved
his sword over his head in triumph, but the next fell lifeless
to the ground, shot through the head by a rifle ball. A more
gallant spirit never achieved a nobler death, and the name
of the young Tennesseean is preserved as a proud designation
by one of the richest counties, as well as by one of the
most flourishing cities, in the State whose soil was baptized
by his blood!</p>

<p>The breastworks having been carried by storm, the Indians
fell back among the trees, brush, and timber of the
peninsula, and kept up a spirited contest. But, in the meantime,
a portion of Coffee&rsquo;s command, and some of the
friendly warriors under their distinguished chief, McIntosh,
had swum across the river, fired the village of Tohopeka,
and carried off the canoes of the enemy. The followers of
Weatherford now became desperate, and from the banks,
hollows, and other fastnesses of the place, fought with fury,
refusing all offers of quarter. The fight continued in severity
for five hours; and the going down of the sun was hailed
by the survivors as furnishing them some chance of escape.
But the hope was, in the main, deceptive.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not more than twenty warriors
are believed to have escaped, under cover of the night.
Among these, strange enough, was the chieftain [Weatherford],
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg&nbsp;304]</a></span>
whose appellation, &ldquo;the Murderer of Fort Mims,&rdquo;
had formed the watch-word and war-cry of his enemies in
this very engagement. Favored by the thick darkness, he
floated down the river with his horse, until below the American
lines, and then reaching the shore, made his way in safety
to the highlands south of the Tallapoosa.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Weatherford could not consent to fly from the nation; he
felt that he owed it, as a duty to his people, not to abandon
them until peace was restored. In this state of mind he
was apprised that the American commander had set a price
upon his head, and refused peace to the other chiefs, unless
they should bring him either dead, or in confinement, to the
American camp, now at Fort Jackson, near the junction of
the rivers. His determination was at once taken in the
same spirit of heroism that always marked his conduct.
Accordingly, mounting his horse, he made his way across
the country, and soon appeared at the lines of the encampment.
At his request, a sentinel conducted him to the
presence of the commander-in-chief, who was seated in his
marquee, in consultation with several of his principal officers.
The stately and noble appearance of the warrior at once excited
the attention and surprise of the General, and he demanded
of the Chief his name and the purpose of his visit.</p>

<p>In calm and deliberate tones, the chieftain said: &ldquo;I am
Weatherford. I have come to ask peace for myself and for
my people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mild dignity with which these words were uttered,
no less than their import, struck the American commander
with surprise. [He hardly knew what to do; but he
allowed some parley and Weatherford made a speech, ending
thus:] &ldquo;General Jackson, you are a brave man: I am
another. I do not fear to die. But I rely on your generosity.
You will exact no terms of a conquered and helpless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg&nbsp;305]</a></span>
people, but those to which they should accede.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You have told us what we may do
and be safe. Yours is a good talk and my nation ought to
listen to it. They <em>shall</em> listen to it!&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>General Jackson acceded to the demands of Weatherford,
and assured him of peace and safety for himself and people.</p>

<h2>THEODORE O&rsquo;HARA.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1820=1867.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Theodore O&rsquo;Hara</span>, son of an Irish exile, was born in
Danville, Kentucky, and educated at St. Joseph Academy,
Bardstown, where he taught Greek to the younger classes
while finishing his senior course. He read law, was appointed
clerk in the Treasury Department at Washington,
1845, and on the outbreak of the Mexican War entered the
army as a soldier, rising to be captain and major. At the
close of the war, he returned to Washington and practised
law. He was afterwards editor of the &ldquo;Mobile Register,&rdquo;
and of the Frankfort &ldquo;Yeoman,&rdquo; in Kentucky, and was
employed in diplomatic missions. He was a colonel in the
Confederate Army, and after the war, settled in Georgia.
On his death the Kentucky Legislature passed a resolution
to remove his remains to Frankfort and lay them beside the
soldiers whom he had so well praised in his &ldquo;Bivouac of
the Dead;&rdquo; and there he rests, the soldier bard, among the
voiceless braves of the Battle of Buena Vista. This poem
was written for the occasion of their interment; and it has
furnished the lines of inscription over the gateways of
several military cemeteries.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Osceola.</p>

<p>His true Indian name was As-se-se-ha-ho-lar, or Black
Drink, but he was commonly called Osceola, or Powell.
He belonged to a Creek tribe called Red Sticks, and was a
half-breed. He removed to Florida with his mother when
a child, and lived near Fort King [three miles east of Ocala].
At the beginning of the Florida war he was about thirty-one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg&nbsp;313]</a></span>
years of age, of medium size, being about five feet eight
inches in height, resolute and manly in his bearing, with
a clear, frank, and engaging countenance. He was undoubtedly
the master-spirit of the war, and by his firmness
and audacity forced the nation into the war which a large
majority were averse to engaging in, and either broke up
every attempt at negotiations or prevented their fulfillment.
He was to have been one of the leaders at Dade&rsquo;s massacre,
but was detained at Fort King by his determination to
gratify his revenge upon General Thompson. He participated
in the battles at the ford of the Withlacoochee and
Camp Izard, and led the attack upon Micanopy, where, with
his force of less than two hundred and fifty men, within
sight of the fort, he attacked upwards of one hundred regular
troops in an open field, supported by a field-piece.</p>

<p>His capture, [October, 1837], by General Hernandez was
due to his audacity and self-confidence. Bad faith, and a
disregard of the usages of civilization, have been imputed
to General Jesup on this occasion, Osceola having come in
under a white flag to negotiate; but that officer contended
that Osceola had broken his faith in reference to the Fort
Dade capitulation [when he had promised to emigrate] and
was to be treated as a prisoner.</p>

<p>From all that can be gathered of his character, Osceola
was possessed of nobler traits than usually belong to his race.
His manners were dignified and courteous, and upon the
field he showed himself a brave and cautious leader. It is
said that he instructed his people in their predatory excursions
to spare the women and children. &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;upon them that we make war and draw the scalping-knife.
It is upon men. Let us act like men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Osceola has furnished to the poet, to the novelist, and to
the lover of romance, a most attractive subject, and scarce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg&nbsp;314]</a></span>
any limit has been placed to the virtues attributed or the
exploits imagined in connection with this renowned chief of
the Seminoles. A poet has sung of him,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;His features are clothed with a warrior&rsquo;s pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he moves with a monarch&rsquo;s tread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He smiles with joy, as the flash of steel<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Through the Everglades&rsquo; grass is seen.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Upon his removal to Charleston, he became dejected and
low-spirited, and gradually pined away. All efforts to interest
him in a Western home failed to arouse him, and in a
few weeks he died of a broken heart, and was buried just
outside of the principal gateway of Fort Moultrie, where

<h2>RICHARD MALCOLM JOHNSTON.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1822= &mdash;&mdash;.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Richard Malcolm Johnston</span> was born in Hancock
County, Georgia. He was professor of Literature in the
University of Georgia, 1857-1861. He served, as colonel,
in the Confederate army, and has since had a school for
boys at Sparta, Georgia, and later near Baltimore.</p>

<p>In connection with Prof. William Hand Browne of Johns
Hopkins, he has published a &ldquo;History of English Literature&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;Life of Alexander H. Stephens.&rdquo; His tales describe
life among the Georgia &ldquo;Crackers&rdquo; and they have many
readers and admirers. His style has the stamp of simple
truth and is irresistible. See <i>Sketch</i> in Miss Rutherford&rsquo;s

<p>The following extract is a true story of an old gentleman
who was Alexander H. Stephens&rsquo; first client.</p>


<h3>MR. HEZEKIAH ELLINGTON&rsquo;S RECOVERY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Life of Alexander H. Stephens.</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>)</p>

<p>The old gentleman was brought very low with malarious
fever, and his physician and family had made up their
minds, that, notwithstanding his extreme reluctance to
depart from this life,&mdash;a reluctance heightened no doubt
by his want of preparation for a better,&mdash;he would be compelled
to go. The system of therapeutics in vogue at that
time and in that section included immense quantities of
calomel, and rigorously excluded cold water. Mr. Ellington
lingered and lingered, and went without water so long and
to such an extent that it seemed to him he might as well die
of the disease as of the intolerable thirst that tormented
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>At last, one night, when his physicians, deeming his case
hopeless, had taken their departure, informing his family
that he could hardly live till morning, and the latter, worn
down by watching, were compelled to take a little rest, he
was left to the care of his constant and faithful servant,
Shadrach, with strict and solemn charge to notify them if
any change took place in his master&rsquo;s condition, and, above
all, under no circumstances to give him cold water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg&nbsp;316]</a></span>
When the rest were all asleep, Mr. Ellington, always
astute and adroit in gaining his ends, and whose faculties
at present were highly stimulated by his extreme necessity,
called out to his attendant in a feeble voice, which he strove
to make as natural and unsuggestive as possible,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadrach, go to the spring and fetch me a pitcher of
water from the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shadrach expostulated, pleading the orders of the doctor
and his mistress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You Shadrach, you had better do what I tell you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shadrach still held by his orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadrach, if you don&rsquo;t bring me the water, when I get
well I&rsquo;ll give you the worst whipping you ever had in your
life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shadrach either thought that if his master got well he
would cherish no rancor towards the faithful servant whose
constancy had saved him, or, more likely, that the prospect
of recovery was far too remote to justify any serious apprehension
for his present disobedience; at all events, he held
firm. The sick man, finding this mode of attack ineffectual,
paused awhile, and then said, in the most persuasive accents
he could employ,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadrach, my boy, you are a good nigger, Shadrach. If
you&rsquo;ll go now and fetch old master a pitcher of nice cool
water, I&rsquo;ll set you free and give you <em>Five Hundred Dollars</em>!&rdquo;
And he dragged the syllables slowly and heavily
from his dry jaws, as if to make the sum appear immeasurably
vast.</p>

<p>But Shadrach was proof against even this temptation.
He only admitted its force by arguing the case, urging that
how could he stand it, and what good would his freedom
and five hundred dollars do him, if he should do a thing
that would kill his old master?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg&nbsp;317]</a></span>
The old gentleman groaned and moaned. At last he
bethought him of one final stratagem. He raised his head
as well as he could, turned his haggard face full upon
Shadrach, and glaring at him from his hollow blood-shot
eyes, said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadrach, I am going to die, and it&rsquo;s because I can&rsquo;t get
any water. If you don&rsquo;t go and bring me a pitcher of
water, after I&rsquo;m dead I&rsquo;ll come back and <small>HAUNT</small> you! I&rsquo;ll
<small>HAUNT</small> you as long as you live!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Lordy! Master! You shall hab de water!&rdquo; cried
Shadrach; and he rushed out to the spring and brought it.
The old man drank and drank,&mdash;the pitcherful and more.
The next morning he was decidedly better, and to the
astonishment of all, soon got well.</p>

<h2>JOHN REUBEN THOMPSON.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1823=1873.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">John Reuben Thompson</span> was born at Richmond, and
educated at the University of Virginia. He studied law,
but practised little, and in 1847 became editor of the &ldquo;Southern
Literary Messenger.&rdquo; This position he filled with great
success for twelve years and he exerted a fine influence on
the literary taste and effort of his times. In this magazine
first appeared the writings of Donald G. Mitchell (&ldquo;Dream
Life&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reveries of a Bachelor&rdquo;), the early pieces of
John Esten Cooke, Philip Pendleton Cooke, Paul Hamilton
Hayne, Henry Timrod, and others.</p>

<p>His delicate health induced him to resign his place in
1859 and to go farther south to Augusta, Georgia, as editor
of the &ldquo;Southern Field and Fireside.&rdquo; In 1863 he travelled
in Europe and his descriptive letters are very bright and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg&nbsp;318]</a></span>
interesting. He later became literary editor of the &ldquo;Evening
Post,&rdquo; N.&nbsp;Y.; in 1872 he went to Colorado in one last but
vain effort to restore his health. He died in 1873 and is
buried in Hollywood Cemetery at Richmond.</p>

<p>His writings, consisting of poems, letters, sketches, and
editorials, are found mainly in the &ldquo;Southern Literary Messenger&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Land We Love.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>JABEZ LAMAR MONROE CURRY.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1825= &mdash;&mdash;.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Curry</span> was born in Georgia, but his father removed
to Alabama in 1838, and he was reared in that State. After
graduation at the University of Georgia and at the Harvard
Law School, he began the practice of law in Talladega
County, Alabama. He served in the State Legislature and
in Congress, and in 1861 entered the Confederate Army.</p>

<p>After the war he was ordained to the Baptist ministry
and became president of Howard College, Alabama, and
later, professor of English, Philosophy, and Law, in
Richmond College, Virginia, which latter position he filled
for thirteen years. From 1881 to 1885 he was agent of the
Peabody Educational Fund; in 1885 he was appointed
minister to Spain, and on his return to America resumed
the agency of the Fund. His wise administration and his
well-directed efforts have done much to further the cause
of education; and his ability and effectiveness as a speaker
and writer have given him national fame.</p>

<h3>RELATIONS BETWEEN ENGLAND AND AMERICA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Gladstone.</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>)</p>

<p>By his frank utterances, expressive of his admiration of
the people and the institutions of the United States, he has
provoked adverse criticism from a portion of the English
press. He thinks the Senate of the United States &ldquo;the
most remarkable of all the inventions of modern politics,&rdquo;
and the American constitution &ldquo;the most wonderful work
ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of
man,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;its exemption from formal change, has certainly
proved the sagacity of its constructors and the stubborn
strength of the fabric.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the same essay&mdash;<i>Kin Beyond Sea</i>&mdash;speaking of our
future, he says, &ldquo;She will probably become what we are
now, the head servant in the great household of the world,
the employer of all employed; because her service will be
the most and the ablest.&rdquo; In 1856, when the relations between
Great Britain and the United States became considerably
strained, in an able speech may be found this sentence:
&ldquo;It appears to me that the two cardinal aims that we
ought to keep in view in the discussion of this question are
peace and a thoroughly cordial understanding with America
for one, the honor and fame of England for the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1884, he wrote: &ldquo;The convulsion of that country between
1861 and 1865 was perhaps the most frightful which
ever assailed a national existence. The efforts which were
made on both sides were marked. The exertions by which
alone the movement was put down were not only extraordinary,
they were what antecedently would have been called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg&nbsp;323]</a></span>
impossible; and they were only rendered possible by the
fact that they proceeded from a nation where every capable
citizen was enfranchised and had a direct and an energetic
interest in the well-being and unity of the State.&rdquo; &ldquo;No
hardier republicanism was generated in New England than
in the slave States of the South, which produced so many
of the great statesmen of America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a conversation with Mr. Gladstone in 1887, he referred
to the enormous power and responsibilities of the United
States, and suggested that a desideratum was a new unity
between our two countries. We had that of race and language,
but we needed a moral unity of English-speaking
people for the success of freedom.</p>

<p>The English or Anglo-Saxon race is essentially the same
in its more distinguishing characteristics. Unity of language
creates unity of thought, of literature, and largely
unity of civilization and of institutions. It facilitates social
and commercial intercourse, and must produce still more
marked political phenomena. We profit naturally by
inventions, by discoveries, by constitutional struggles, by
civil and religious achievements, by lessons of traditions,
by landmarks of usage and prescription. Magna Charta,
Petition of Right, Habeas Corpus, what O&rsquo;Connell even
called the &ldquo;glorious Revolution of 1688,&rdquo; are as much
American as English.</p>

<p>England claims to have originated the representative
system six hundred years ago. Our ancestors brought to
this soil, &ldquo;singularly suited for their growth, all that was
democratic in the policy of England and all that was
Protestant in her religion.&rdquo; Our revolution, like that of
1688, was in the main a vindication of liberties inherited.
In freedom of religion, in local self-government, and
somewhat in state autonomy, our forefathers constructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg&nbsp;324]</a></span>
for themselves; but nearly all the personal guarantees, of
which we so much boast on our national anniversaries, were
borrowed from the mother country.</p>

<h3>BIG JOHN, ON THE CHEROKEES.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Fireside Sketches.</i><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>)</p>

<p>Big John had had a little war experience&mdash;that is, he had
volunteered in a company to assist in the forcible removal
of the Cherokees to the far west in 1835. It was said that
he was no belligerent then, but wanted to see the maiden
that he loved a safe transit, and so he escorted the old chief
and his clan as far as Tuscumbia, and then broke down and
returned to Ross Landing on the Tennessee River. He was
too heavy to march, and when he arrived at the Landing, a
prisoner was put in his charge for safe keeping. Ross
Landing is Chattanooga now, and John Ross lived there,
and was one of the chiefs of the Cherokees. The prisoner
was his guest, and his name was John Howard Payne. He
was suspected of trying to instigate the Cherokees to revolt
and fight, and not leave their beautiful forest homes on the
Tennessee and Coosa and Oostanaula and the Etowah and
Connasauga rivers. He brought Payne back as far as New
Echota, or New Town, as it was called, an Indian settlement
on the Coosawattee, a few miles east of Calhoun, as
now known. There he kept the author of &ldquo;Home, Sweet
Home&rdquo; under guard, or on his parole of honor, for three
weeks, and night after night slept with him in his tent, and
listened to his music upon the violin, and heard him sing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg&nbsp;328]</a></span>
his own sad songs until orders came for his discharge, and
Payne was sent under escort to Washington.</p>

<p>Many a time I have heard Big John recite his sad adventures.
&ldquo;It was a most distressive business,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Them
Injuns was heart-broken; I always knowd an Injun loved his
hunting-ground and his rivers, but I never knowd how much
they loved &rsquo;em before. You know they killed Ridge for
consentin&rsquo; to the treaty. They killed him on the first day&rsquo;s
march and they wouldent bury him. We soldiers had to
stop and dig a grave and put him away. John Ross and
John Ridge were the sons of two Scotchmen, who came
over here when they were young men and mixed up with
these tribes and got their good will. These two boys were
splendid looking men, tall and handsome, with long auburn
hair, and they were active and strong, and could shoot a
bow equal to the best bowman of the tribe, and they beat
&rsquo;em all to pieces on the cross-bow. They married the
daughters of the old chiefs, and when the old chiefs died
they just fell into line and succeeded to the old chiefs&rsquo;
places, and the tribes liked &rsquo;em mighty well, for they were
good men and made good chiefs. Well, you see Ross dident
like the treaty. He said it wasent fair and that the
price of the territory was too low, and the fact is he dident
want to go at all. There are the ruins of his old home
now over there in De Soto, close to Rome, and I tell you
he was a king. His word was the law of the Injun nations,
and he had their love and their respect. His half-breed
children were the purtiest things I ever saw in my life.
Well, Ridge lived up the Oostanaula River about a mile,
and he was a good man, too. Ross and Ridge always consulted
about everything for the good of the tribes, but Ridge
was a more milder man than Ross, and was more easily
persuaded to sign the treaty that gave the lands to the
State and to take other lands away out to the Mississippi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg&nbsp;329]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, it took us a month to get &rsquo;em all together and begin
the March to the Mississippi, and they wouldn&rsquo;t march then.
The women would go out of line and set down in the woods
and go to grieving; and you may believe it or not, but I&rsquo;ll
tell you what is a fact, we started with 14,000, and 4,000 of
&rsquo;em died before we got to Tuscumbia. They died on the
side of the road; they died of broken hearts; they died of
starvation, for they wouldent eat a thing; they just died all
along the way. We didn&rsquo;t make more than five miles a day
on the march, and my company didn&rsquo;t do much but dig
graves and bury Injuns all the way to Tuscumbia. They
died of grief and broken hearts, and no mistake. An Injun&rsquo;s
heart is tender, and his love is strong; it&rsquo;s his nature.
I&rsquo;d rather risk an Injun for a true friend than a white man.
He is the best friend in the world and the worst enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>ST. GEORGE H. TUCKER.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1828=1863.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">St. George H. Tucker</span>, grandson of Judge St. George
Tucker, was born at Winchester, Virginia. He was clerk of
the Virginia Legislature: and in 1861 he entered the Confederate
service and rose to be Lieutenant-Colonel. He died
from exposure in the Seven Days&rsquo; Battles around Richmond,
1862.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;Hansford&rdquo; is considered one of the best of historical
romances and gives a vivid picture of Virginia in the
seventeenth century under Governor Berkeley.</p>

<h3>BURNING OF JAMESTOWN IN 1676.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Hansford.</i>)</p>

<p>Scarcely had Berkeley and his adherents departed on
their flight from Jamestown, when some of the disaffected
citizens of the town, seeing the lights in the palace so suddenly
extinguished, shrewdly suspected their design. Without
staying to ascertain the truth of their suspicions, they
hastened with the intelligence to General Bacon, and threw
open the gates to the insurgents. Highly elated with the
easy victory they had gained over the loyalists, the triumphant
patriots forgetting their fatigue and hunger, marched
into the city, amid the loud acclamations of the fickle populace.
But to the surprise of all there was still a gloom
resting upon Bacon and his officers. That cautious and far-seeing
man saw at a glance, that although he had gained an
immense advantage over the royalists, in the capture of the
metropolis, it was impossible to retain it in possession long.
As soon as his army was dispersed, or engaged in another
quarter of the colony, it would be easy for Berkeley, with
the navy under his command, to return to the place, and
erect once more the fallen standard of loyalty.</p>

<p>While then, the soldiery were exulting rapturously over
their triumph, Bacon, surrounded by his officers, was
gravely considering the best policy to pursue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My little army is too small,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to leave a garrison
here, and so long as they remain thus organized peace will
be banished from the colony; and yet I cannot leave the
town to become again the harbour of these treacherous
loyalists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can suggest no policy that is fit to pursue, in such an
emergency,&rdquo; said Hansford, &ldquo;except to retain possession of
the town, at least until the Governor is fairly in Accomac
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg&nbsp;331]</a></span>
&ldquo;That, at best,&rdquo; said Bacon, &ldquo;will only be a dilatory proceeding,
for sooner or later, whenever the army is disbanded,
the stubborn old governor will return and force us
to continue the war. And besides I doubt whether we
could maintain the place with Brent besieging us in front,
and the whole naval force of Virginia, under the command
of such expert seamen as Gardiner and Larimore, attacking
us from the river. No, no, the only way to untie the Gordian
knot is to cut it, and the only way to extricate ourselves
from this difficulty is to burn the town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This policy, extreme as it was, in the necessities of their
condition was received with a murmur of assent. Lawrence
and Drummond, devoted patriots, and two of the
wealthiest and most enterprising citizens of the town,
evinced their willingness to sacrifice their private means to
secure the public good, by firing their own houses. Emulating
an example so noble and disinterested, other citizens
followed in their wake. The soldiers, ever ready for excitement,
joined in the fatal work. A stiff breeze springing up
favored their designs, and soon the devoted town was
enveloped in the greedy flames.</p>

<p>From the deck of the <i>Adam and Eve</i>, the loyalists witnessed
the stern, uncompromising resolution of the rebels.
The sun was just rising, and his broad, red disc was met in
his morning glory with flames as bright and as intense as
his own. The Palace, the State House, the large Garter
Tavern, the long line of stores, and the Warehouse, all in
succession were consumed. The old Church, the proud old
Church, where their fathers had worshipped, was the last
to meet its fate. The fire seemed unwilling to attack its
sacred walls, but it was to fall with the rest; and as the
broad sails of the gay vessel were spread to the morning
breeze, which swelled them, that devoted old Church was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg&nbsp;332]</a></span>
seen in its raiment of fire, like some old martyr, hugging
the flames which consumed it, and pointing with its tapering
steeple to an avenging Heaven.</p>

<h2>GEORGE WILLIAM BAGBY.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1828=1883.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Bagby</span> was born in Buckingham County, Virginia,
and educated at Edge Hill, New Jersey, and the University
of Pennsylvania. He took his degree in the study of medicine,
and made his residence in Richmond. He was correspondent
for several papers, wrote some very witty letters
under the pen-name of &ldquo;Mozis Addums,&rdquo; and made a reputation
as a humorous lecturer. From 1859 to 1862 he was
editor of the &ldquo;Southern Literary Messenger,&rdquo; ably succeeding
John R. Thompson in that position: and from 1870 to
1878 he was State Librarian of Virginia.</p>

<p>His writings are not only witty but wise as well, and
give many interesting aspects of Southern life and manners.
A selection from them has been published by Mrs.
Bagby, under the title &ldquo;Writings of Dr. Bagby&rdquo; (1884-6).
Among them are: My Uncle Flatback&rsquo;s Plantation, Meekins&rsquo;s
Twinses, Jud. Brownin&rsquo;s Account of Rubinstein&rsquo;s
Playing, Bacon and Greens, or the True Virginian, What
I Did with my Fifty Millions, [a sort of Utopian Prophecy.]</p>


<h3>JUD. BROWNIN&rsquo;S ACCOUNT OF RUBINSTEIN&rsquo;S PLAYING.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;When he first sot down he &rsquo;peared to keer mighty little
&rsquo;bout playin&rsquo;, and wished he hadn&rsquo;t come. He tweedle-leedled
a little on the trible, and twoodle-oodle-oodled some
on the bass&mdash;just foolin&rsquo; and boxin&rsquo; the thing&rsquo;s jaws for bein&rsquo;
in his way. And I says to a man settin&rsquo; next to me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg&nbsp;333]</a></span>
s&rsquo;I, &lsquo;What sort of fool playin&rsquo; is that?&rsquo; And he says,
&lsquo;Heish!&rsquo; But presently his hands commenced chasin&rsquo; one
&rsquo;nother up and down the keys, like a passel of rats scamperin&rsquo;
through a garret very swift. Parts of it was sweet,
though, and reminded me of a sugar squirrel turnin&rsquo; the
wheel of a candy cage. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; I says to my neighbor,
&lsquo;he&rsquo;s showing&rsquo; off. He thinks he&rsquo;s a-doin&rsquo; of it; but he
ain&rsquo;t got no idee, no plan of nuthin&rsquo;. If he&rsquo;d play me up
a tune of some kind or other, I&rsquo;d&rsquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my neighbor says, &lsquo;Heish!&rsquo; very impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just about to git up and go home, bein&rsquo; tired of
that foolishness, when I heard a little bird wakin&rsquo; up away
off in the woods, and callin&rsquo; sleepy-like to his mate, and I
looked up and I see that Ruben was beginnin&rsquo; to take interest
in his business, and I set down agin. It was the peep
of day. The light come faint from the east, the breeze
blowed gentle and fresh, some more birds waked up in the
orchard, then some more in the trees near the house, and all
begun singin&rsquo; together. People begun to stir, and the gal
opened the shutters. Just then the first beam of the sun
fell upon the blossoms; a leetle more and it techt the roses
on the bushes, and the next thing it was broad day; the
sun fairly blazed; the birds sang like they&rsquo;d split their little
throats; all the leaves was movin&rsquo;, and flashin&rsquo; diamonds of
dew, and the whole wide world was bright and happy as a
king. Seemed to me like there was a good breakfast in
every house in the land, and not a sick child or woman
anywhere. It was a fine mornin&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I says to my neighbor, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s music, that is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he glared at me like he&rsquo;d like to cut my throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently the wind turned; it begun to thicken up, and
a kind of gray mist come over things; I got low-spirited
d&rsquo;rectly. Then a silver rain began to fall; I could see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg&nbsp;334]</a></span>
drops touch the ground; some flashed up like long pearl
ear-rings; and the rest rolled away like round rubies. It
was pretty, but melancholy. Then the pearls gathered
themselves into long strands and necklaces, and then they
melted into thin silver streams running between golden
gravels, and then the streams joined each other at the bottom
of the hill, and made a brook that flowed silent except
that you could kinder see the music specially when the
bushes on the banks moved as the music went along down
the valley. I could smell the flowers in the meadows.
But the sun didn&rsquo;t shine, nor the birds sing; it was a
foggy day, but not cold. Then the sun went down, it got
dark, the wind moaned and wept like a lost child for its
dead mother, and I could a-got up then and there and
preached a better sermon than any I ever listened to. There
wasn&rsquo;t a thing in the world left to live for, not a blame
thing, and yet I didn&rsquo;t want the music to stop one bit. It
was happier to be miserable than to be happy without being
miserable. I couldn&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Then, all of a sudden, old Ruben changed his tune. He
ripped and he rar&rsquo;d, he tipped and he tar&rsquo;d, he pranced and
he charged like the grand entry at a circus. &rsquo;Peared to me
like all the gas in the house was turned on at once, things
got so bright, and I hilt up my head, ready to look any
man in the face, and not afeared of nothin&rsquo;. It was a circus,
and a brass band, and a big ball, all goin&rsquo; on at the
same time. He lit into them keys like a thousand of brick,
he gave &rsquo;em no rest, day nor night; he set every living joint
in me agoin&rsquo;, and not bein&rsquo; able to stand it no longer, I
jumpt spang onto my seat, and jest hollered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Go it, my Rube!</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every blamed man, woman, and child in the house riz
on me, and shouted &lsquo;Put him out! Put him out!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg&nbsp;335]</a></span>
&ldquo;With that some several p&rsquo;licemen run up, and I had to
simmer down. But I would a fit any fool that laid hands on
me, for I was bound to hear Ruby out or die.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had changed his tune agin. He hopt-light ladies
and tip-toed fine from eend to eend of the key-board. He
played soft, and low, and solemn. I heard the church bells
over the hills. The candles in heaven was lit, one by one.
I saw the stars rise. The great organ of eternity began to
play from the world&rsquo;s end to the world&rsquo;s end, and all the
angels went to prayers. Then the music changed to water,
full of feeling that couldn&rsquo;t be thought, and began to drop&mdash;drip,
drop, drip, drop&mdash;clear and sweet, like tears of joy
fallin&rsquo; into a lake of glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He stopt a minute or two, to fetch breath. Then he
got mad. He run his fingers through his hair, he shoved
up his sleeves, he opened his coat-tails a leetle further, he
drug up his stool, he leaned over, and, sir, he just went for
that old pianner. He slapt her face, he boxed her jaws, he
pulled her nose, he pinched her ears, and he scratched her
cheeks, till she farly yelled. He knockt her down and
he stompt on her shameful. She bellowed like a bull, she
bleated like a calf, she howled like a hound, she squealed
like a pig, she shrieked like a rat, and then he wouldn&rsquo;t
let her up. He run a quarter-stretch down the low grounds
of the bass, till he got clean into the bowels of the earth,
and you heard thunder galloping after thunder, through the
hollows and caves of perdition; and then he fox-chased his
right hand with his left till he got away out of the trible
into the clouds, whar the notes was finer than the pints of
cambric needles, and you couldn&rsquo;t hear nothin&rsquo; but the shadders
of &rsquo;em. And then he wouldn&rsquo;t let the old pianner go.
He fetchet up his right wing, he fetcht up his left wing, he
fetcht up his center, he fetcht up his reserves. He fired by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg&nbsp;336]</a></span>
file, he fired by platoons, by company, by regiments, and by
brigades. He opened his cannon, siege-guns down thar,
Napoleons here, twelve-pounders yonder, big guns, little
guns, middle-sized guns, round shot, shell, shrapnel, grape,
canister, mortars, mines, and magazines, every livin&rsquo; battery
and bomb a goin&rsquo; at the same time. The house trembled,
the lights danced, the walls shuk, the floor come up, the
ceilin&rsquo; come down, the sky split, the ground rockt&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bang!</span>
With that <em>bang!</em> he lifted hisself bodily into the ar&rsquo;, and
he come down with his knees, his ten fingers, his ten toes,
his elbows, and his nose, strikin&rsquo; every single solitary key
on that pianner at the same time. The thing busted and
went off into seventeen hundred and fifty-seven thousand
five hundred and forty-two hemi-demi-semi-quivers, and I
know&rsquo;d no mo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>A CONFEDERATE EXILE ON HIS WAY TO MEXICO, 1866.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Recollections of Henry W. Allen, Ex-Gov. of Louisiana.</i><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>)</p>

<p>The people wept over Allen&rsquo;s departure. They followed
him with tears and blessings, and would have forced on him
more substantial tokens of regard than words of regret.
They knew he had no money&mdash;his noble estates had long
been in possession of the enemy; hundreds of hogsheads of
sugar had been carried off from his plundered sugar-houses;
his house was burned, his plantation, a wide waste of fallow-fields,
grown up in weeds. He had nothing but Confederate
and State money. One gentleman begged him to
accept $5,000, in gold, <em>as a loan</em>, since he refused it as a gift.
Allen accepted five hundred. With this small amount, his
ambulance and riding-horses, he started to Mexico. His
journey through Texas was a complete ovation, instead of
a hegira. Everybody, rich and poor, vied with each other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg&nbsp;339]</a></span>
in offering him attention and the most eager hospitality.
The roof was deemed honored that sheltered his head for
the night. He stopped at Crockett, to say &ldquo;goodbye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>This conversation occurred whilst we were returning
from a visit to Gov. Moore&rsquo;s family. I had driven over to
their cottage in a buggy, to invite them to join us at dinner.
Allen had accompanied me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
These exiles were personal friends of mine. I suffered in
parting with them: for some I suffer still&mdash;for those who
are still absent and still living! Everything was very quiet
and still, nothing audible but the low murmur of our voices,
when suddenly arose from the prairie beyond us, one of the
beautiful, plaintive, cattle or &ldquo;salt&rdquo; songs of Texas. These
wild simple melodies had a great attraction for me. I
would often check my horse on the prairies, and keep him
motionless for a half-hour, listening to these sweet, melancholy
strains. Like all cattle-calls, they are chiefly minor.
I thought them quite as singular and beautiful as the Swiss
<i>Ranz des Vaches</i>, or the Swedish cattle-calls. They consisted
of a few chanted words, with a cadence and a long
<i>yodl</i>. Sometimes the yodling was aided by what the Texan
boys called &ldquo;quills&rdquo;&mdash;two or more pipes made of reed&mdash;<em>cane</em>
(arundinaria macrosperma). This made a sort of limited
syrinx, which gave wonderful softness and flute-like clearness
to the prolonged tones of the voice, as it was breathed
into them. The boy sang one of his saddest &ldquo;calls.&rdquo; I
looked quickly to see if Gov. Allen had noticed the melancholy
words and mournful air. I saw he had. He ceased
talking, and his face was very grave.</p>

<p>The boy sang:</p>

<p>This had always been an affecting strain to me; it was
doubly so under the existing circumstances. The song
died mournfully away. We drove on in silence for a few
moments. Gov. Allen roused himself, with a sigh: &ldquo;That
boy&rsquo;s song is very sad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he sings it very frequently. He knows nothing
about you. It is neither a prophecy nor intended to be
sympathetic,&mdash;you need not make special application of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but it may prove a strange coincidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t say that. I won&rsquo;t listen to such a thought.
You&rsquo;ll only spend a pleasant summer travelling in Mexico.
We&rsquo;ll see you at the opera in New Orleans, next winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg&nbsp;341]</a></span>
Our conversation reverted now to past years. Allen
spoke of his early friends among my relatives; of his whole
career in Louisiana; of his wife, with tenderness,&mdash;[she had
died in 1850], of her beauty and her love for him. His
future was so uncertain&mdash;that he scarcely alluded to that&mdash;never
with any hopefulness. It was only in the past that
he seemed to find repose of spirit. The present was too sad,
the future too shadowy for any discussion of either&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>During this last visit, I never renewed my arguments
against his quitting the country. I had already said and
written all that I had to say on that subject&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Besides, our minds were in such a confused state, we
scarcely knew what any of us had to expect from the victorious
party, or what would become of our whole people.
So that in urging him not to leave Louisiana, I argued more
from instinct, which revolted at anything like an abandonment
of a post of duty, and from a temperament which always
sought rather to advance to meet and defy danger,
than to turn and avoid it, than from any well-grounded assurance
or hope of security for him, or any one else. I felt
more anxiety for his reputation, for his fame, than for his
life and freedom. His natural instincts would have induced
similar views; but his judgment and feelings were overpowered
by the reasonings and entreaties of his friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Timrod</span> was born in Charleston, the son of William
Henry Timrod, who was himself a poet, and who in
his youth voluntarily apprenticed himself to a book-binder
in order to have plenty of books to read. His son Henry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg&nbsp;343]</a></span>
the &ldquo;blue-eyed Harry&rdquo; of the father&rsquo;s poem studied law
with the distinguished James Louis Petigru, but never
practiced and soon gave it up to prepare himself for a
teacher. He spent ten years as private tutor in families,
writing at the same time. Some of his poems are found
in the &ldquo;Southern Literary Messenger&rdquo; with the signature
&ldquo;Agla&uuml;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His vacations were spent in Charleston, where he was
one of the coterie of young writers whom William Gilmore
Simms, like a literary Nestor, gathered about him in
his hospitable home. His schoolmate, Paul Hamilton
Hayne, was one of these, and their early friendship grew
stronger with the passing years.</p>

<p>In 1860, Timrod removed to Columbia, published a volume
of poems which were well received North and South,
and undertook editorial work. Life seemed fair before him.
But ill-health and the war which destroyed his property
and blighted his career, soon darkened all his prospects,
and after a brave struggle with poverty and sickness, he
died of pneumonia.</p>

<p>His poems are singularly free from sadness and bitterness.
They have been collected and published with a sketch of
his life by his friend, Paul Hamilton Hayne.</p>

<p>Of all our poets none stands higher than Henry Timrod.
His singing is true and musical, and his thoughts are pure
and noble. A tardy recognition seems at last coming to
bless his memory, and his poems are in demand. One copy
of his little volume recently commanded the price of ten
dollars.</p>

<h2>PAUL HAMILTON HAYNE.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1830=1886.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Paul Hamilton Hayne</span> has been justly called the &ldquo;Laureate
of the South.&rdquo; He was born at Charleston, and being
left an orphan by the death of his father, Lieutenant Hayne
of the Navy, he was reared and educated by his uncle,
Robert Young Hayne. His fortune was ample, but he
studied law although he never practised. He became editor
of &ldquo;Russell&rsquo;s Magazine&rdquo; and a contributor to the &ldquo;Southern
Literary Messenger.&rdquo; His genius and lovely nature
made him a favorite with all of his companions, among
whom were notably William Gilmore Simms and Henry
Timrod.</p>

<p>During the Civil War, he served in the Confederate
Army; his entire property, the inheritance of several generations,
was destroyed in the bombardment of Charleston.
From 1865 till his death he resided at &ldquo;Copse Hill,&rdquo; a small
cottage home in the pine hills near Augusta, Georgia, &ldquo;keeping
the wolf from the door only by the point of his pen,&rdquo;
dearly honored and loved by all who knew him or his poems.</p>

<p>His son, William H. Hayne, is also a poet of much ability,
and has published a volume of &ldquo;Sylvan Lyrics.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;There is no poet in America who has written more
lovingly or discriminatingly about nature in her ever varying
aspects. We are sure that in his loyal allegiance to her,
he is not a whit behind Wordsworth, and we do not hesitate
to say that he has often a grace that the old Lake-poet
lacks.&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Preston.</p>

<h2>JOHN ESTEN COOKE.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1830=1886.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">John Esten Cooke</span> was born at Winchester, Virginia, a
younger brother of Philip Pendleton Cooke and son of the
eminent jurist, John Rogers Cooke, under whom he made
his law studies. He seemed, however, to prefer literature
to law, and when he was twenty-four he had already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg&nbsp;351]</a></span>
published several works. Among them was &ldquo;Virginia Comedians,&rdquo;
a novel of great interest and greater promise.</p>

<p>In 1861 he entered the Confederate service as one of
General T.&nbsp;J. Jackson&rsquo;s staff, was transferred to that of
General J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Stuart at the death of Jackson in 1863;
and after Stuart&rsquo;s death, he was Inspector-General of the
horse artillery of the Army of Northern Virginia till the
close of the war.</p>

<p>His novels deal with the life and history of Virginia, the
best known of them being &ldquo;Surry of Eagle&rsquo;s Nest,&rdquo; which
is said to be partly autobiographical. They hold well the
popular favor. His &ldquo;Stories of the Old Dominion&rdquo; are
specially interesting to Virginians.</p>

races comes, the country is alive for miles around with persons
of all classes and descriptions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg&nbsp;352]</a></span>
As the hour of noon approaches, the ground swarms with
every species of the genus <i>homo</i>; Williamsburg and the sea-faring
village of Jamestown turn out <i>en masse</i>, and leave all
occupations for the exciting turf.</p>

<p>As the day draws on the crowd becomes more dense.
The splendid chariots of the gentry roll up to the stand, and
group themselves around it, in a position to overlook the
race-course, and through the wide windows are seen the
sparkling eyes and powdered locks, and diamonds and gay
silk and velvet dresses of those fair dames who lent such
richness and picturesque beauty to the old days dead now
so long ago in the far past. The fine-looking old planters
too are decked in their holiday suits, their powdered hair is
tied into queues behind with neat black ribbon, and they
descend and mingle with their neighbors, and discuss the
coming festival.</p>

<p>Gay youths, in rich brilliant dresses, caracole up to the
carriages on fiery steeds, to display their horsemanship, and
exchange compliments with their friends, and make pretty
speeches, which are received by the bright-eyed damsels with
little ogles, and flirts of their variegated fans, and rapturous
delight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowd grows each moment, as the flood
pours in from the north, the south, the east, the west&mdash;from
every point of the compass, and in every species of vehicle.
There are gay parties of the yeomen and their wives and
daughters, in carryalls and wagons filled with straw, upon
which chairs are placed: there are rollicking fast men&mdash;if
we may use a word becoming customary in our own day&mdash;who
whirl in, in their curricles: there are barouches and
chairs, spring wagons and carts, all full, approaching in
every way from a sober walk to a furious headlong dash,
all &ldquo;going to the races.&rdquo; There are horsemen who lean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg&nbsp;353]</a></span>
forward, horsemen who lean back; furious, excited horsemen
urging their steeds with whip and spur; cool, quiet
horsemen, who ride erect and slowly; there are, besides,
pedestrians of every class and appearance, old and young,
male and female, black and white&mdash;all going to the races.</p>

<p>The hour at last arrives, and a horn sounding from the
judges&rsquo; stand, the horses are led out in their blankets and
head-coverings, and walked up and down before the crowd
by their trainers, who are for the most part old gray-headed
negroes, born and raised, to the best of their recollection,
on the turf. The riders are noble scions of the same ancient
stock, and average three feet and a half in height,
and twenty pounds in weight. They are clad in ornamental
garments; wear little close-fitting caps; and while they are
waiting, sit huddled up in the grass, sucking their thumbs,
and talking confidentially about &ldquo;them there hosses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us look at the objects of their attention; they are well
worth it.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard enters the bay horse <i>Sir Archy</i>, out of Flying
Dick, by Roderick.</p>

<p>Mr. James enters <i>Fair Anna</i>, a white mare, dam Virginia,
sire Belgrave.</p>

<p>Captain Waters enters the Arabian horse <i>Selim</i>, descended
in a direct line, he is informed, from Al-borak, who
carried the prophet Mahomet up to heaven&mdash;though this
pedigree is not vouched for. The said pedigree is open to
the inspection of all comers. <em>Note</em>&mdash;That it is written in
Arabic.</p>

<p>There are other entries, but not much attention is paid to
them. The race will be between Sir Archy and Fair Anna,
and perhaps the outlandish horse will not be &ldquo;distanced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prepare the horses!&rdquo; comes from the judges&rsquo; stand opposite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg&nbsp;354]</a></span>
Captain Ralph Waters leaves the ladies with a gallant
bow, and pushes his way through the swaying and excited
crowd, toward the spot where the animals are being saddled.</p>

<p>A tremendous hurly-burly reigns there; men of all
classes, boys, negroes, gentlemen, indented servants,&mdash;all
are betting with intense interest. The dignified grooms endeavor
to keep back the crowd:&mdash;the owners of the horses
give their orders to the microscopic monkeys who are to
ride.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The riders
are raised by one leg into the saddles; they gather up the
reins; the drum taps; they are off like lightning.</p>

<p>The course is a mile in circumference, and they go round
it before the excited crowd can look at them a dozen times.
They whirl past the stand, and push on again.</p>

<p>Sir Archy leads; Fair Anna trails on a hard rein; the
Arabian is two lengths behind; but he is not running.</p>

<p>They thunder up the quarter stretch: Sir Archy is bounding,
like some diabolical monster, far before his companions,
spite of his owner&rsquo;s cries; the Arabian has come up
and locks the mare; they run neck and neck. Sir Archy
whirls past the stand, and wins by a hundred yards. The
immense crowd utters a shout that shakes the surrounding
forest.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The horses are again enveloped in their hoods and blankets.
Captain Ralph returns to the Riverhead carriage,
[that of the Lees, in which were Miss Henrietta Lee and
her sister Clare.]</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any more betting, sir?&rdquo; says Miss Henrietta, satirically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuredly!&rdquo; says the Captain; &ldquo;do not think, <i>chere
ma&rsquo;m&rsquo;selle</i>, that I am very much cast down. I am so far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg&nbsp;355]</a></span>
from that, I assure you, that I am ready to take the field
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you will bet again, madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien!</i> I now stake all that is left me in the world&mdash;though
not quite. I stake my horse, Selim, against the
curl and the pair of gloves you wear, with the knot of
ribbons at your girdle thrown in&mdash;all upon the final issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henrietta blushes; for, however common such gallant
proposals were at that day, she cannot misunderstand the
meaning of the soldier&rsquo;s glance, and reddens beneath it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be unfair, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so, my dear madam, for are you not sure to lose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To lose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I am sure to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! you ladies have such a delicious little confidence
in the things you patronize, that it is really astonishing.
You think Sir Archy will beat Selim? Pshaw! you know
nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This piques madam Henrietta, and she smiles satirically
again as she says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I do not want your pretty horse&mdash;but if you
insist, why, I cannot retreat. I shall, at least, have the
pleasure of returning him to his master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain shakes his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bet upon such terms is no bet at all, my dearest
madam,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;for, I assure you, if I win, you will
return home curl-less, glove-less, and ribbon-less. All is
fair in war&mdash;and love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With which words, Captain Ralph darts a martial ogle
at his companion. This piques her more than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg&nbsp;356]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; she replies, &ldquo;if you are determined, have
your desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cries the Captain, &ldquo;we are just in time. There
is the horse.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And, with another gallant bow, the Captain rides away
towards the horses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The boys are again instructed much after the same fashion:
the signal is given in the midst of breathless suspense,
and the horses dart from their places.</p>

<p>They dart around, Sir Archy again leading: but this
position he does not hold throughout the first mile: he
gradually falls behind, and when they pass the winning-post
he is fifty yards in the rear. His owner tears his hair,
but the crowd do not see him&mdash;they flush and shout.</p>

<p>The second mile is between Fair Anna and the Arabian,
and they lock in the middle of it; but the Arabian gradually
takes the lead, and when they flash up to the stand he
is ten yards ahead. Sir Archy is distanced and withdrawn.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the excitement of the
crowd:&mdash;the tremendous effect produced upon them by this
reversal of all their hopes and expectations. They roll
about like waves, they shout, they curse, they rumble and
groan like a stormy sea.</p>

<p>The horses are the objects of every one&rsquo;s attention.
Their condition will go far to indicate the final result&mdash;and
Sir Archy being led away and withdrawn, the race now
will be between Fair Anna and the Arabian.</p>

<p>Mr. James looks more solemn than ever, and all eyes are
turned upon him. Captain Waters is not visible&mdash;he is
yonder, conversing with the ladies.</p>

<p>But the horses! Fair Anna pants and breathes heavily:
her coat is drenched more completely than before with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg&nbsp;357]</a></span>
perspiration; her mouth foams; she tosses her head; when
the rake is applied to her back a shower falls.</p>

<p>The Arabian is wet all over too; but he breathes regularly;
his eye is bright and his head calm. He has commenced
running. The first intention of Mr. James is to
give up the race, but his pride will not let him. He utters
an oath, and gives renewed instructions to his rider. These
instructions are to whip and spur&mdash;to take the lead and
keep it, from the start.</p>

<p>The moment for the final struggle arrives, and Captain
Ralph merely says, &ldquo;Rein free!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys mount&mdash;the crowd opens; the drum taps and
the animals are off like lightning.</p>

<p>Fair Anna feels that all her previous reputation is at
stake, and flies like a deer. She passes around the first
mile like a flash of white light; but the Arabian is beside
her. For a quarter of a mile thereafter they run
neck and neck&mdash;the rider of fair Anna lashes and spurs
desperately.</p>

<p>They come up to the quarter-stretch in the last mile at
supernatural speed:&mdash;the spectators rise on their toes and
shout:&mdash;two shadows pass them like the shadows of darting
hawks:&mdash;the mare barely saves her distance and the
Arabian has triumphed.</p>

<p>If we could not describe the excitement after the second
heat, what possibility is there that we could convey an idea
of the raging and surging pandemonium which the crowd
now came to resemble? Furious cries&mdash;shouts&mdash;curses&mdash;applause&mdash;laughter&mdash;and
the rattle of coin leaving unwilling
hands are some of the sounds. But here we must give
up:&mdash;as no mere pen can describe the raging of a great mass
of water lashed by an angry wind into foam and whistling
spray and muttering waves, which rise and fall and crash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg&nbsp;358]</a></span>
incessantly, so we cannot trace the outline of the wildly
excited crowd.</p>

<p>[Afterwards come contests with the quarter-staff, a
wrestling match, running matches, a contest of singing
among &ldquo;a dozen blushing maidens,&rdquo; and of fiddling among
twenty bold musicians: and the day is wound up with a
great banquet.]</p>

<h2>ZEBULON BAIRD VANCE.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1830=1894.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Zebulon Baird Vance</span> was born in Buncombe County,
North Carolina, and was educated at Washington College,
Tennessee, and at the University of North Carolina. He
studied law and began its practice in Asheville. He was
soon elected to the State Legislature and to Congress;
and from 1854 to his death was continuously in public life
except just after the war. His wit and eloquence made him
a great favorite both on the stump and in Congress, and the
influence he wielded in his state was unbounded. He was
opposed to secession, but joined his state in her decision and
became colonel of the 26th North Carolina Regiment, one
of the best of the army.</p>

<p>In 1862 he was elected governor of the State and was so
active and enterprising in getting aid by sea for the cause
that he was called the &ldquo;War Governor of the South.&rdquo; He
was in favor of considering the negotiations for peace in
1863, but he neglected no measures to insure the success of
the Confederacy. In 1865 he was held a prisoner of war
for a few weeks in Washington.</p>

<h3>CHANGES WROUGHT BY THE WAR.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From All About it&mdash;an address before the young men of Raleigh, N.&nbsp;C.; published in
&ldquo;Land We Love&rdquo; January, 1867.</i>)</p>

<p>Virginia to the north of us was settled by English Cavaliers;
South Carolina, mainly by French Huguenots,
both among the noblest stocks of Western Europe. North
Carolina, with but a slight infusion of each, was settled by
a sturdier&mdash;and in some respects&mdash;a better race than either.
She was emphatically the offspring of religious and political
persecution, and the vital stream of her infant life was
of Scotch-Irish origin. A cross of those two noble races
has produced a breed of men as renowned for great deeds
and modest worth as perhaps any other in this world. Two
instances will suffice for this. Perhaps the most manly and
glorious feat of arms in modern times was the defence of
Londonderry, as the boldest and most remarkable state paper
was the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. Both
were the work mainly of men such as settled North Carolina.</p>

<p><i>The Country Gentlemen.</i>&mdash;Perhaps one of the most
remarkable changes which we may expect, is one that
will soon be apparent on the face of our country society.
The abolition of slavery will do wonders here. It puts
an end to the reign of those lordly-landed proprietors,
planters, and farmers, who constituted so striking and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg&nbsp;361]</a></span>
so pleasant a feature in our rural population. No longer
the masters of hundreds of slaves wherewith to cultivate
their thousands of acres, the general cheapness of
lands in the South will prevent their forming around them
a system of dependent tenantry, since every industrious
man will be able to plough his own farm. They will therefore
gradually sell off their paternal acres, no longer within
the scope of prudent management, and seek homes in the
towns and villages, or contract their establishments to their
means and altered condition. Agriculture will then pass
gradually into the hands of small farmers, and the great
farms will forever disappear.</p>

<p>I can scarcely imagine it possible for any one to view the
steady disappearance of the race of Southern country gentlemen
without genuine sorrow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the high-toned, educated, chivalrous, intelligent, and hospitable
Southern gentlemen, of whom each one who hears me
has at least a dozen in his mind&rsquo;s eye in Virginia and the
Carolinas: whose broad fields were cultivated by their own
faithful and devoted slaves, whose rudely splendid mansions
stand where their fathers reared them, among the oaks
and the pines which greeted the canoe of John Smith, welcomed
the ships of Raleigh, and sheltered the wild cavaliers
of De Soto; whose hall doors stood wide open, and
were never shut except against a retreating guest;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> whose
cellar and table abounded with the richest products of the
richest lands in the world, and whose hospitality was yet
unstained by unrefined excess; whose parlors and fire-sides
were adorned by a courtly female grace which might vie
with any that ever lighted and blessed the home of man;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg&nbsp;362]</a></span>
whose hands were taught from infancy to fly open to every
generous and charitable appeal, and whose minds were
inured to all self-respect and toleration, and whose strong
brains were sudden death to humbuggery, all the <em>isms</em>, and
the whole family of mean and pestilential fanaticism.</p>

<p><i>The Negroes.</i>&mdash;There is also a great change at hand for the
negro.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Who that knew him as a contented,
well-treated slave, did not learn to love and admire the
negro character? I, for one, confess to almost an enthusiasm
on the subject. The cheerful ring of their songs at their
daily tasks, their love for their masters and their families,
their politeness and good manners, their easily bought but
sincere gratitude, their deep-seated aristocracy&mdash;for your
genuine negro was a terrible aristocrat,&mdash;their pride in their
own and their master&rsquo;s dignity, together with their overflowing
and never-failing animal spirits, both during hours of
labor and leisure, altogether, made up an aggregation of
joyous simplicity and fidelity&mdash;when not perverted by
harsh treatment&mdash;that to me was irresistible!</p>

<p>A remembrance of the seasons spent among them will
perish only with life. From the time of the ingathering of
the crops, until after the ushering in of the new year, was
wont to be with them a season of greater joy and festivity
than with any other people on earth, of whom it has been
my lot to hear. In the glorious November nights of our
beneficent clime, after the first frosts had given a bracing
sharpness and a ringing clearness to the air, and lent that
transparent blue to the heavens through which the stars
gleam like globes of sapphire, when I have seen a hundred
or more of them around the swelling piles of corn, and
heard their tuneful voices ringing with the chorus of some
wild refrain, I have thought I would rather far listen to
them than to any music ever sung to mortal ears; for it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg&nbsp;363]</a></span>
was the outpouring of the hearts of happy and contented
men, rejoicing over the abundance which rewarded the
labor of the closing year! And the listening, too, has
many a time and oft filled my bosom with emotions, and
opened my heart with charity and love toward this subject
and dependent race, such as no oratory, no rhetoric or minstrelsy
in all this wide earth could impart!</p>

<p>Nature ceased almost to feel fatigue in the joyous scenes
which followed. The fiddle and the banjo, animated as it
would seem like living things, literally knew no rest, night
or day; while Terpichore covered her face in absolute
despair in the presence of that famous <em>double-shuffle</em> with
which the long nights and &ldquo;master&rsquo;s shoes&rdquo; were worn
away together!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Who can forget the cook by whom his youthful appetite
was fed? The fussy, consequential old lady to whom I now
refer, has often, during my vagrant inroads into her rightful
domains, boxed my infant jaws, with an imperious, &ldquo;Bress
de Lord, git out of de way: dat chile never kin git enuff&rdquo;:
and as often relenting at sight of my hungry tears, has fairly
bribed me into her love again with the very choicest bits of
the savory messes of her art. She was haughty as Juno,
and aristocratic as though her naked ancestors had come over
with the Conqueror, or &ldquo;drawn a good bow at Hastings,&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and yet her pride invariably melted at
the sight of certain surreptitious quantities of tobacco, with
which I made my court to this high priestess of the region
sacred to the stomach.</p>

<p>And there, too, plainest of all, I can see the fat and chubby
form of my dear old nurse, whose encircling arms of love
fondled and supported me from the time whereof the memory
of this man runneth not to the contrary. All the strong
love of her simple and faithful nature seemed bestowed on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg&nbsp;364]</a></span>
her mistress&rsquo; children, which she was not permitted to give
to her own, long, long ago left behind and dead in &ldquo;ole
Varginney.&rdquo; Oh! the wonderful and touching stories of
them, and a hundred other things, which she has poured
into my infant ears! How well do I remember the marvellous
story of the manner in which she obtained religion, of
her many and sore conflicts with the powers of darkness,
and of her first dawning hopes in that blessed gospel whose
richest glory is, that it is preached to the poor, such as she
was! From her lips, too, I heard my first ghost-story!
Think of that! None of your feeble make-believes of a
ghost-story either, carrying infidelity on its face; but a real
bona-fide narrative, witnessed by herself, and told with the
earnestness of truth itself. How my knees smote together,
and my hair stood on end, &ldquo;so called&rdquo;&mdash;as I stared and
startled, and declared again and again with quite a sickly
manhood indeed, that <em>I wasn&rsquo;t scared a bit</em>!</p>

<p>Perhaps the proudest day of my boyhood was when I was
able to present her with a large and flaming red cotton
handkerchief, wherewith in turban style she adorned her
head. And my satisfaction was complete when my profound
erudition enabled me to read for her on Sabbath afternoons
that most wonderful of all stories, the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.
Nor was it uninstructive, or a slight tribute to the
genius of the immortal tinker&mdash;could I but have appreciated
it&mdash;to observe the varied emotions excited within her breast
by the recital of those fearful conflicts by the way, and of
the unspeakable glories of the celestial City, within whose
portals of pearl I trust her faithful soul has long since
entered!</p>

<h2>ALBERT PIKE.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1809=1891.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Albert Pike</span> was born in Boston, but after his twenty-second
year made his home in the South. He was a student
at Harvard and taught for a while; in 1831, he went to
Arkansas, walking, it is said, five hundred miles of the way,
as his horse had run away in a storm.</p>

<p>He became an editor and then a lawyer, cultivating letters
at the same time, and wrote the &ldquo;Hymns to the Gods.&rdquo; He
served in the Mexican and Civil Wars, with rank in the
latter of Brigadier-General in the Confederate army. He
afterwards made his home in Washington City, where he
at first practised his profession, but later gave his attention
mostly to literature and Freemasonry.</p>

<h3>MAJOR JONES&rsquo;S CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO MARY STALLINGS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Major Jones&rsquo;s Courtship.</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>)</p>

<p>They all agreed they would hang up a bag for me to put
Miss Mary&rsquo;s Crismus present in, on the back porch; and
about ten o&rsquo;clock I told &rsquo;em good-evenin&rsquo; and went home.</p>

<p>I sot up till midnight, and when they wos all gone to bed,
I went softly into the back gate, and went up to the porch,
and thar, shore enough, was a great big meal-bag hangin&rsquo; to
the jice. It was monstrous unhandy to git to it, but I was
termined not to back out. So I sot some chairs on top of a
bench, and got hold of the rope, and let myself down into
the bag; but jist as I was gittin in, it swung agin the chairs,
and down they went with a terrible racket; but nobody
din&rsquo;t wake up but Miss Stallinses old cur dog, and here he
come rippin and tearin through the yard like rath, and
round and round he went, tryin to find out what was the
matter. I scrooch&rsquo;d down in the bag, and didn&rsquo;t breathe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg&nbsp;369]</a></span>
louder nor a kitten, for fear he&rsquo;d find me out; and after a
while he quit barkin.</p>

<p>The wind begun to blow bominable cold, and the old bag
kept turnin round and swingin so it made me sea-sick as
the mischief. I was afraid to move for fear the rope would
break and let me fall, and thar I sot with my teeth rattlin
like I had a ager. It seemed like it would never come daylight,
and I do believe if I didn&rsquo;t love Miss Mary so powerful
I would froze to death; for my heart was the only spot
that felt warm, and it didn&rsquo;t beat more&rsquo;n two licks a minit,
only when I thought how she would be supprised in the
mornin, and then it went in a canter. Bimeby the cussed
old dog came up on the porch and begun to smell about the
bag, and then he barked like he thought he&rsquo;d treed something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bow! wow! wow!&rdquo; ses he. Then he&rsquo;d smell agin, and
try to git up to the bag. &ldquo;Git out!&rdquo; ses I, very low, for
fear the galls mought hear me. &ldquo;Bow! wow!&rdquo; ses he.
&ldquo;Begone! you bominable fool!&rdquo; ses I, and I felt all over in
spots, for I spected every minit he&rsquo;d nip me, and what made
it worse, I didn&rsquo;t know wharabouts he&rsquo;d take hold. &ldquo;Bow!
wow! wow!&rdquo; Then I tried coaxin&mdash;&ldquo;Come here, good
feller,&rdquo; ses I, and whistled a little to him, but it wasn&rsquo;t no
use. Thar he stood, and kep up his everlastin barkin and
whinin, all night. I couldn&rsquo;t tell when daylight was
breakin, only by the chickens crowin, and I was monstrous
glad to hear &rsquo;em, for if I&rsquo;d had to stay thar one hour more,
I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d ever got out of that bag alive.</p>

<p>Old Miss Stallins come out fust, and as soon as she seed
the bag, ses she: &ldquo;What upon yeath has Joseph went
and put in that bag for Mary? I&rsquo;ll lay it&rsquo;s a yearlin or
some live animal, or Bruin wouldn&rsquo;t bark at it so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went in to call the galls, and I sot thar, shiverin all
over so I couldn&rsquo;t hardly speak if I tried to,&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t
say nothin. Bimeby they all come runnin out on the porch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg&nbsp;370]</a></span>
&ldquo;My goodness! what is it?&rdquo; ses Miss Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo; ses Miss Kesiah. &ldquo;I seed it move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call Cato, and make him cut the rope,&rdquo; ses Miss Carline,
&ldquo;and let&rsquo;s see what it is. Come here, Cato, and get
this bag down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt it for the world,&rdquo; ses Miss Mary.</p>

<p>Cato untied the rope that was round the jice, and let the
bag down easy on the floor, and I tumbled out, all covered
with corn-meal from head to foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo; ses Miss Mary, &ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t the
Majer himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; ses I, &ldquo;and you know you promised to keep my
Crismus present as long as you lived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The galls laughed themselves almost to death, and went
to brushin off the meal as fast as they could, sayin they was
gwine to hang that bag up every Crismus till they got husbands
too. Miss Mary&mdash;bless her bright eyes!&mdash;she blushed
as beautiful as a mornin-glory, and sed she&rsquo;d stick to her
word.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do believe if I was froze
stiff, one look at her sweet face, as she stood thar lookin
down to the floor with her roguish eyes, and her bright curls
fallin all over her snowy neck, would have fotched me to.
I tell you what, it was worth hangin in a meal bag from
one Crismus to another to feel as happy as I have ever sense.</p>

<h3>THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE POETICAL.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From Poetry of the Future.</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>)</p>

<p>The relation between the Beautiful and Beauty on the
one hand, and the Poetical and Poetry on the other, has
generally been seen, when seen at all, vaguely; that is to
say, seen as the Beautiful and the Poetical themselves have
been seen&mdash;&ldquo;in a mirror darkly.&rdquo; This indistinctness seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg&nbsp;374]</a></span>
to have grown out of the faulty views of nature taken by
the speculators.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
In brief, then, Nature is an effect&mdash;a
product&mdash;of a Power lying behind or above it; and it
stands, accordingly, to that Power in the relation of an
effect to a cause. That cause we shall describe as Spiritual;
the effect, as Natural. The Natural, or Nature, is the material
Universe embracing the three kingdoms, known as
mineral, vegetable, and animal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Such being the case, everything in nature is a correspondent
of some thing&mdash;is expressive of and consequently representative
and exponential of something&mdash;above it or behind
it; and that something is an idea&mdash;a thing not material.
It follows, then, that every object in nature has real
character in itself as a representative of an idea; just as,
say, an anchor is representative of hope, a heart, of love, an
olive branch, of peace, and a ring, of marriage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>We next come to consider the percipient mind. Men&rsquo;s
minds have limited and imperfect faculties and capabilities.
That which is good, or true, or beautiful, to one mind can
hardly be the same in the same way and degree to any other
mind. It is true&mdash;as some writers have stated, but none
seems willing to push the propositions to their legitimate
conclusions&mdash;that the Good and the Beautiful are true, the
Beautiful and the True are good, and the True and the
Good are beautiful. We wish to accept the propositions in
their most comprehensive scope and with all their legitimate
consequences.</p>

<p>Let us note, at this point, the fact, obvious enough but
generally overlooked, that in perception the result depends
far more upon the percipient mind than upon the object
perceived. To a ploughboy, a pebble is an insignificant
thing, suggestive possibly of some discomfort in walking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg&nbsp;375]</a></span>
and fit only to shy at a bird, may be; but to the geologist
it appears worthy a volume, and speaks to him of strata
may be a million of years old, of glacial attrition, of volcanic
action, of chemical constituents, of mineralogical
principles, and crystallogenic attraction, of mathematical
laws and geometric angles, and of future geognostic
changes. That is to say, the pebble contracts and expands,
as it were, with the faculties and the prejudices of the person&mdash;of
the mind&mdash;that sees it.</p>

<p>Or, again: The crescent moon is visible in the clear sky.
<i>A</i> sees a bright convenience which enables him to walk
better&mdash;not so good a light as the full moon would be, but
valuable as far as it goes. <i>B</i> sees a lovely luminary to
light him to his lady-love, a hallowed eye half shut that
watches with protecting radiance over her slumbers. <i>C</i>
reckons the intervening 238,000 miles, its diameter of
2,162.3 miles, and his mind busies itself with orbits, radii,
ellipses, eclipses, azimuth, parallax, sidereal periods, satellitic
inclinations, and synodic revolutions. <i>D</i>, with a turn
for symbols and history, sees in it something of the &ldquo;ornaments
like the moon&rdquo; that Gideon captured from the
Sheikhs Zebah and Zalmunna, something of Byzantine
siege, Ottoman ensign, the Crusades, the Knighthood of
Selim, the battle of Tours, and the city of New
Orleans.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The Beautiful&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is a relation
between the man that sees and the object seen. A perfectly
harmonious relation brings perfect beauty.</p>

<p>The Poetical&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the beautiful;
and this may be expressed either in prose or in
poetry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Poetry, more closely defined, is the poetical expressed in
rhythmical language.</p>

the fierce persecutions of Leopold, abandoned their homes

Holland, and England, where their past sufferings and

came from the town of Berchtolsgaden and its vicinity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
On the 2d of December they embarked
for England. On the 8th of January, 1734 (O.&nbsp;S.), having
a favorable wind, they departed in the ship <i>Purisburg</i> for
Savannah.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Upon the return of Mr. Oglethorpe
and the commissary, Baron Von Reck, [sent to examine the
site of the new colony] to Savannah, nine able-bodied Salzburgers
were dispatched, by the way of Abercorn, to Ebenezer,
to cut down trees and erect shelters for the new colonists.
On the 7th of April the rest of the emigrants
arrived, and, with the blessing of the good Mr. Bolzius,
entered at once upon the task of clearing land, constructing
bridges, building shanties, and preparing a road-way to
Abercorn. Wild honey found in a hollow tree greatly
refreshed them, and parrots and partridges made them &ldquo;a
very good dish.&rdquo; Upon the sandy soil they fixed their
hopes for a generous yield of peas and potatoes. To the
&ldquo;black, fat, and heavy&rdquo; land they looked for all sorts of
corn. From the clayey soil they purposed manufacturing
bricks and earthenware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg&nbsp;378]</a></span>
On the first of May lots were drawn upon which houses
were to be erected in the town of Ebenezer. The day following,
the hearts of the people were rejoiced by the coming
of ten cows and calves,&mdash;sent as a present from the
magistrates of Savannah in obedience to Mr. Oglethorpe&rsquo;s
orders. Ten casks &ldquo;full of all Sorts of Seeds&rdquo; arriving
from Savannah set these pious people to praising God for
all his loving kindnesses. Commiserating their poverty, the
Indians gave them deer, and their English neighbors taught
them how to brew a sort of beer made of molasses, sassafras,
and pine tops. Poor Lackner dying, by common consent
the little money he left was made the &ldquo;Beginning
of a Box for the Poor.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
By appointment, Monday, the 13th
of May, was observed by the congregation as a season of
thanksgiving.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Of the town of Savannah, the Baron Von Reck favors
us with the following impressions: &ldquo;I went to view this
rising Town, <i>Savannah</i>, seated upon the Banks of a River
of the same Name. The Town is regularly laid out, divided
into four Wards, in each of which is left a spacious Square
for holding of Markets and other publick Uses. The Streets
are all straight, and the Houses are all of the same Model
and Dimensions, and well contrived for Conveniency. For
the Time it has been built it is very populous, and its
Inhabitants are all White People. And indeed the Blessing
of God seems to have gone along with this Undertaking,
for here we see Industry honored and Justice strictly
executed, and Luxury and Idleness banished from this
happy Place where Plenty and Brotherly Love seem to
make their Abode, and where the good Order of a Nightly
Watch restrains the Disorderly and makes the Inhabitants
sleep secure in the midst of a Wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg&nbsp;379]</a></span>
&ldquo;There is laid out near the Town, by order of the Trustees,
a Garden for making Experiments for the Improving Botany
and Agriculture; it contains 10 Acres and lies upon
the River; and it is cleared and brought into such Order
that there is already a fine Nursery of Oranges, Olives,
white Mulberries, Figs, Peaches, and many curious Herbs:
besides which there are Cabbages, Peas, and other European
Pulse and Plants which all thrive. Within the Garden
there is an artificial Hill, said by the Indians to be
raised over the Body of one of their ancient Emperors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had like to have forgot one of the best Regulations
made by the Trustees for the Government of the Town of
<i>Savannah</i>. I mean the utter Prohibition of the Use of
Rum, that flattering but deceitful Liquor which has been
found equally pernicious to the Natives and new Comers,
which seldoms fails by Sickness or Death to draw after it
its own Punishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="address">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Wmsburg</span>, <i>ye 7th of Octr, 1722</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Dear Sukey</i>, Madam Ball of Lancaster and Her Sweet
Molly have gone Hom. Mamma thinks Molly the Comliest
Maiden She Knows. She is about 16 yrs old, is taller than
Me, is very Sensable, Modest and Loving. Her Hair is
like unto Flax, Her Eyes are the color of Yours, and her
Chekes are like May blossoms. I wish you could see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We do seem to see her in lingering over the portrait done
in miniature in colors that are fresh to this day. It is, as if
in exploring a catacomb, we had happened upon a fair
chamber adorned with a frescoed portrait of a girl-princess
of a legendary age. Romancist and biographer are one as
we study the picture line by line. The brush was dipped
in the limner&rsquo;s heart and wrought passing well.</p>


<h3>MADAM WASHINGTON AT THE PEACE BALL.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the Same.</i>)</p>

<p>Her only public appearance as the hero&rsquo;s mother was at
the Peace Ball given in Fredericksburg during the visit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg&nbsp;382]</a></span>
Washington to that town. With all her majestic self-command,
she did not disguise the pleasure with which she
received the special request of the managers that she would
honor the occasion with her presence. There was even a
happy flutter in the playful rejoinder that &ldquo;her dancing
days were pretty well over, but that if her coming would
contribute to the general pleasure she would attend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A path was opened from the foot to
the top of the hall as they appeared in the doorway, and
&ldquo;every head was bowed in reverence.&rdquo; It must have been
the proudest moment of her life, but she bore herself with
perfect composure then, and after her son, seating her in an
armchair upon the da&iuml;s reserved for distinguished guests,
faced the crowd in prideful expectancy that all his friends
would seek to know his mother. She had entered the hall
at eight o&rsquo;clock, and for two hours held court, the most distinguished
people there pressing eagerly forward to be presented
to her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From her slightly
elevated position, she could, without rising, overlook the
floor, and watched with quiet pleasure the dancers, among
them the kingly figure of the Commander-in-Chief, who
led a Fredericksburg matron through a minuet.</p>

<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock, she signed to him to approach, and rose
to take his arm, saying in her clear soft voice, &ldquo;Come,
George, it is time for old folks to be at home.&rdquo; Smiling a
good-night to all, she walked down the room, as erect in
form and as steady in gait as any dancer there.</p>

<p>One of the French officers exclaimed aloud, as she disappeared:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If such are the matrons of America, she may well boast
of illustrious sons!&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Lafayette&rsquo;s report of his interview to his friends at Mt.
Vernon was: &ldquo;I have seen the only Roman matron living
at this day!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>AUGUSTA EVANS WILSON.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1835= &mdash;&mdash;.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wilson</span> was born at Columbus, Georgia, but early
removed to Mobile, Alabama. Her first novel was &ldquo;Inez:
a Tale of the Alamo,&rdquo; published in 1855. She was married
to Mr. L.&nbsp;M. Wilson of Mobile in 1868, and they had
a delightful suburban home at Spring Hill. Since Mr.
Wilson&rsquo;s death, she resides in Mobile. Her novels, especially
&ldquo;St. Elmo,&rdquo; have made a great sensation in the reading
world: they evince great ability and learning. See
Miss Rutherford&rsquo;s &ldquo;American Authors.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>WORKS.</h3>

<p class="works">
Inez: a Tale of the Alamo.<br />
Macaria.<br />
Vashti.<br />
At the Mercy of Tiberius.<br />
Beulah.<br />
St. Elmo.<br />

</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>St. Elmo</i> contains a description of that marvel of oriental
architecture, the Taj Mahal at Agra in India,&mdash;a marble
tomb erected to perpetuate the name of Noormahal,
whom Tom Moore has immortalized in his &lsquo;Lalla Rookh.&rsquo;
A recent traveller visiting Agra in 1891 writes that he was
surprised to find a Parsee boy almost in the shadow of the
Taj Mahal reading a copy of the London edition of Mrs.
Wilson&rsquo;s <i>Vashti</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Her style has
been severely criticised as pedantic, but certainly this charge
may with equal justice be brought against George Meredith,
Bulwer, and George Eliot, and it is well established
that Mrs. Wilson&rsquo;s books have in many instances stimulated
her young readers to study history, mythology, and the sciences,
from which she so frequently draws her illustrations.&rdquo;&mdash;Miss

<h3>A LEARNED AND INTERESTING CONVERSATION.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From St. Elmo.</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>)</p>

<p>Edna had risen to leave the room when the master of the
house entered, but at his request resumed her seat and continued
reading.</p>

<p>After searching the shelves unavailingly, he glanced over
his shoulder and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen my copy of De Gu&eacute;rin&rsquo;s Centaur anywhere
about the house? I had it a week ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, for causing such a fruitless
search; here is the book. I picked it up on the front steps
where you were reading a few evenings since, and it opened
at a passage that attracted my attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She closed the volume and held it toward him, but he
waved it back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep it if it interests you. I have read it once, and
merely wished to refer to a particular passage. Can you
guess what sentence most frequently recurs to me? If so,
read it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew a chair close to the hearth and lighted his
cigar.</p>

<p>Hesitatingly Edna turned the leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, sir, that my selection will displease you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will risk it, as, notwithstanding your flattering
opinion to the contrary, I am not altogether so unreasonable
as to take offense at a compliance with my own
request.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still she shrank from the task he imposed, and her fingers
toyed with the scarlet fuchsias; but after eyeing her for a
while, he leaned forward and pushed the glass bowl beyond
her reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edna, I am waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg&nbsp;385]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, then, Mr. Murray, I should think that these two
passages would impress you with peculiar force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raising the book, she read with much emphasis:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou pursuest after wisdom, O Melampus! which is
the science of the will of the gods; <em>and thou roamest from
people to people, like a mortal driven by the destinies</em>. In
the times when I kept my night-watches before the caverns,
I have sometimes believed that I was about to surprise the
thoughts of the sleeping Cybele, and that the mother of
the gods, betrayed by her dreams, would let fall some of her
secrets. But I have never yet made out more than sounds
which faded away in the murmur of night, or words inarticulate
as the bubbling of the rivers.&rsquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
&lsquo;Seekest thou to know the gods, O Macareus! and from
what source, men, animals, and elements of the universal
fire have their origin? The aged ocean, the father of all
things, keeps locked within his own breast these secrets;
and the nymphs who stand around sing as they weave their
eternal dance before him, to cover any sound which might
escape from his lips, half opened by slumber. Mortals
dear to the gods for their virtue have received from their
hands lyres to give delight to man, or the seeds of new
plants to make him rich, but from their inexorable lips&mdash;nothing!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Murray, am I correct in my conjecture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite correct,&rdquo; he answered, smiling grimly.</p>

<p>Taking the book from her hand he threw it on the table,
and tossed his cigar into the grate, adding in a defiant, challenging
tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mantle of Solomon did not fall at Le Cayla on the
shoulders of Maurice de Gu&eacute;rin. After all he was a
wretched hypochondriac, and a tinge of <i>le cahier vert</i> doubtless
crept into his eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg&nbsp;386]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do you forget, sir, that he said, &lsquo;When one is a wanderer,
one feels that one fulfils the true condition of humanity?&rsquo;
and that among his last words are these, &lsquo;The stream
of travel is full of delight. Oh! who will set me adrift on
this Nile?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me if I remind you, <i>par parenth&egrave;se</i>, of the preliminary
and courteous <i>En garde!</i> which should be pronounced
before a thrust. De Gu&eacute;rin felt starved in Languedoc,
and no wonder! But had he penetrated every
nook and cranny of the habitable globe, and traversed the
vast zaarahs which science accords the universe, he would
have died at last as hungry as Ugolino. I speak advisedly;
for the true Io gad-fly, <i>ennui</i>, has stung me from hemisphere
to hemisphere, across tempestuous oceans, scorching
deserts, and icy mountain ranges. I have faced alike the
bourrans of the steppes, and the Samieli of Shamo, and
the result of my vandal life is best epitomized in those
grand but grim words of Bossuet: &lsquo;<i>On trouve au fond du
tout le vide et le n&eacute;ant!</i>&rsquo; Nineteen years ago, to satisfy my
hunger, I set out to hunt the daintiest food this world could
furnish, and, like other fools, have learned finally, that life
is but a huge mellow golden &Ouml;sher, that mockingly sifts its
bitter dust upon our eager lips. Ah! truly, <i>on trouve au
fond du tout le vide et le n&eacute;ant</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Murray, if you insist upon your bitter &Ouml;sher simile,
why shut your eyes to the palpable analogy suggested?
Naturalists assert that the Solanum, or apple of Sodom,
contains in its normal state neither dust nor ashes; unless
it is punctured by an insect, (the Tenthredo), which converts
the whole of the inside into dust, leaving nothing but
the rind entire, without any loss of color. Human life is
as fair and tempting as the fruit of &lsquo;Ain Jidy,&rsquo; till stung
and poisoned by the Tenthredo of sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg&nbsp;387]</a></span>
All conceivable <i>suaviter in modo</i> characterized his mocking
countenance and tone, as he inclined his haughty head
and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you favor me by lifting on the point of your dissecting
knife this stinging sin of mine to which you refer?
The noxious brood swarm so teasingly about my ears that
they deprive me of your cool, clear, philosophic discrimination.
Which particular Tenthredo of the buzzing swarm
around my spoiled apple of life would you advise me to
select for my <i>anathema maranatha</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of your history, sir, I am entirely ignorant; and even
if I were not, I should not presume to levy a tax upon it in
discussions with you; for, however vulnerable you may possibly
be, I regard an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> as the weakest
weapon in the armory of dialectics&mdash;a weapon too often
dipped in the venom of personal malevolence. I merely
gave expression to my belief that miserable useless lives are
sinful lives.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h2>JAMES RYDER RANDALL.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1839= &mdash;&mdash;.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">James Ryder Randall</span> was born in Baltimore, and his
fame rests upon his stirring war-song, &ldquo;Maryland, my
Maryland,&rdquo; which has been called the &ldquo;Marseillaise of the
Confederacy.&rdquo; It was written in 1861 and set by Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg&nbsp;390]</a></span>
Burton Harrison to the tune of the old college song &ldquo;Lauriger
Horatius,&rdquo; on the wings of which it quickly flew all
over the South.</p>

<p>His profession is that of an editor, and his delicate
health has compelled his residence in a warmer latitude
than his native city, in Louisiana and Georgia.</p>

<h2>SIDNEY LANIER.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1842=1881.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sidney Lanier</span> was born in Macon, Georgia, descended
from a line of artist ancestors, through whom he inherited
great musical ability. He was educated at Oglethorpe College,
being graduated in 1860. He and his brother Clifford
entered the Confederate Army together in 1861 and served
through the war; but the exposure and hardships and imprisonment
developed consumption which finally caused his
death.</p>

<p>After the war he lived for two years in Alabama as a
clerk and a teacher; but his health failed and he was forced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg&nbsp;395]</a></span>
to return home where he practised law with his father till
1873. Then deciding to devote himself to music and poetry,
he went to Baltimore where he was engaged as first
flute in the Peabody Symphony Concerts and in 1879 as lecturer
on English Literature in Johns Hopkins University.
His dread disease never relaxed and he was often obliged
to quit work and go to Florida, North Carolina, Georgia,
and Pennsylvania in search of strength. His death occurred
at Lynn, Polk County, North Carolina, on his last quest for
strength and life with which to continue the work he so
much loved.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;Science of English Verse&rdquo; is said to be a new and
valuable addition to the study of poetry. His poems belong
to the new order of thought and life. His &ldquo;Tiger-Lilies&rdquo;
is a prose-poem, written in three weeks just after
the war and laid in the mountains of Tennessee and on the
eastern shore of Virginia where he was stationed. &ldquo;Beauty
is holiness, and holiness is beauty,&rdquo; was his favorite remark
on the subject of Art. His work and influence are growing
in importance in the regard of students.</p>

<p>In 1876 he was invited to write the poem for the Centennial
Exposition; and the &ldquo;Meditation of Columbia,&rdquo; composed
with the musical expression always in mind,&mdash;and so
too it should be read,&mdash;was the grand Ode that graced the
opening day at Philadelphia. See under <i>Waitman Barbe</i>.</p>

<p>A strange mixture of human life there was in Gray&rsquo;s
school. There were the native little Kentuckians, born in
the wilderness&mdash;the first wild, hardy generation of new
people; and there were the little folk from Virginia, from
Tennessee, from North Carolina, and from Pennsylvania
and other sources, huddled together, some rude, some gentle,
and starting out now to be formed into the men and women
of the Kentucky that was to be.</p>

<p>They had their strange, sad, heroic games and pastimes,
those primitive children under his guidance. Two little
girls would be driving the cows home about dusk; three
little boys would play Indian and capture them and carry
them off; the husbands of the little girls would form a
party to the rescue; the prisoners would drop pieces of their
dresses along the way; and then at a certain point of the
woods&mdash;it being the dead of night now, and the little girls
being bound to a tree, and the Indians having fallen asleep
beside their smouldering camp-fires&mdash;the rescuers would
rush in, and there would be whoops and shrieks, and the
taking of scalps, and a happy return.</p>

<p>Or, some settlement would be shut up in a fort besieged.
Days would pass. The only water was a spring outside the
walls, and around this the enemy skulked in the corn and
grass. But the warriors must not perish of thirst. So, with a
prayer, a tear, a final embrace, the little women marched out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg&nbsp;400]</a></span>
through the gates to the spring, in the very teeth of death,
and brought back water in their wooden dinner-buckets.</p>

<p>Or, when the boys would become men with contests of
running, and pitching quoits, and wrestling, the girls would
play wives and have a quilting in a house of green alder-bushes,
or be capped and wrinkled grandmothers sitting
beside imaginary spinning-wheels and smoking imaginary
pipes.</p>

<p>Sometimes it was not Indian warfare, but civil strife.
For one morning as many as three Daniel Boones appeared
on the playground at the same moment; and at once there
was a fierce battle to ascertain which was the genuine
Daniel. This being decided, the spurious Daniels submitted
to be the one Simon Kenton, the other General
George Rogers Clarke.</p>

<p>This was to be a great day for what he called his class in
history. Thirteen years before, and forty miles away, had
occurred the most dreadful of all the battles&mdash;the disaster
of the Blue Licks; and in town were many mothers who
yet wept for sons, widows who yet dreamed of young husbands,
fallen that beautiful August day beneath the oaks
and cedars, or floating down the red-dyed river.</p>

<p>It was this that he had promised to tell them at noon;
and a little after twelve o&rsquo;clock he was standing with them
on the bank of the Town Fork, in order to give vividness
to his description. This stream flows unseen beneath the
streets of the city [Lexington] now, and with scarce current
enough to wash out its grimy channels; but then it
flashed broad and clear through the long valley which
formed the town common&mdash;a valley of scattered houses
with orchards and corn-fields and patches of cane.</p>

<p>A fine poetic picture he formed as he stood there amid
their eager upturned faces, bare-headed under the cool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg&nbsp;401]</a></span>
brilliant sky of May, and reciting to them, as a prose-minstrel
of the wilderness, the deeds of their fathers.</p>

<p>This Town Fork of the Elkhorn, he said, must represent
the Licking River. On that side were the Indians; on
this, the pioneers, a crowd of foot and horse. There
stretched the ridge of rocks, made bare by the stamping of
the buffalo; here was the clay they licked for salt. In that
direction headed the two ravines in which Boone had
feared an ambuscade. And thus variously having made
ready for battle, and looking down for a moment into the
eyes of a freckly impetuous little soul who was the Hotspur
of the playground, he repeated the cry of McGary,
which had been the signal for attack:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let all who are not cowards follow me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>[Hereupon the soldiers plunged through the river, not
seeing the Indians nor even knowing where they were; and
in a few minutes they were attacked and completely routed
by the Indians who were concealed in the woods and ravines
of the other bank, as Boone had feared. Boone&rsquo;s son
was killed, and he himself narrowly escaped by dashing
through one of the ravines and swimming the river lower
down. The slaughter in the river was great, and the pursuit
was continued for twenty miles. Never had Kentucky
experienced so fatal a blow as that at the Blue Licks.&mdash;L.&nbsp;M.]</p>

<p>Here Uncle Remus paused, and drew a two-pound yam
out of the ashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the fox eat the rabbit?&rdquo; asked the little boy to
whom the story had been told.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s all de fur de tale goes,&rdquo; replied the old man.
&ldquo;He mout, en den agin he moutent. Some say Jedge B&rsquo;ar

<h3>ASCENT OF MOUNT MITCHELL, BLACK MOUNTAIN, NORTH
CAROLINA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From The Land of the Sky.</i><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>)</p>

<p>The sun is shining brightly, and his golden lances light
up the depths of the forest into which we enter&mdash;an enchanted
world of far-reaching greenness, the stillness of
which is only broken by the voice of the streams which
come down the gorges of the mountain in leaping cascades.
Few things are more picturesque than the appearance of a
cavalcade like ours following in single file the winding
path (not road) that leads into the marvelous, mysterious
wilderness. When the ascent fairly begins, the path is
often like the letter S, and one commands a view of the
entire line&mdash;of horsemen in slouched hats and gray coats,
of ladies in a variety of attire, with water-proof cloaks
serving as riding-skirts, and hats garlanded with forest
wreaths and grasses. The guide tramps steadily ahead,
leading the pack-horse, and we catch a glimpse of his face
now and then as he turns to answer some question addressed
to him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wind up the side of the mountain like this for several
miles,&rdquo; says Eric, &ldquo;then we travel along a ridge for
some distance, and finally we ascend the peak formerly
called the Black Dome, now Mount Mitchell. The whole
distance is about twelve miles, and the most of it is steady
climbing.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was in this wilderness that Professor Mitchell
lost his life sixteen or seventeen years ago, was it not?&rdquo; I
ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Burnett [the guide] was one of the men engaged
in the search for him. He will tell you all about it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg&nbsp;410]</a></span>
The forest around us becomes wilder, greener, more luxuriant
at every step.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Presently,
however, the aspect of our surroundings changes. We
leave this varied forest behind, and enter the region of the
balsam, from the dark color of which the mountain takes
its name. Above a certain line of elevation no trees are
found save these beautiful yet sombre firs. They grow to
an immense height and stand so thickly together that one
marvels how any animal larger than a cat can thread its
way among their stems. Overhead the boughs interlock in
a canopy, making perpetual shade beneath. No shrubs of
any kind are to be found here&mdash;only beds of thick elastic
moss, richer than the richest velvet, and ferns in plumy
profusion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dan Burnett leads
on, and presently we emerge on the largest and most beautiful
of the little prairies through which we have passed.
This stretch of open ground lies at the foot of the highest
peak, the abrupt sides of which rise in conical shape before
us. It is here, Mr. Burnett tells us, that the mountaineers
who were searching for Professor Mitchell found the first
trace of the way he had taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had been searchin&rsquo; from Friday to Tuesday,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;and on Tuesday we was pretty nigh disheartened,
when Wilson&mdash;an old hunter from over in Yancey&mdash;said he
hadn&rsquo;t no doubt the professor had tried to go down to
Caney Valley by a trail they two had followed thirteen
years afore, and which leads that way&rdquo;&mdash;he points down
into the dark wilds below us. &ldquo;Well, we looked along the
edge of this here prairie till we found a track. Wilson was
right&mdash;he <em>had</em> tried to go down to Caney Valley. We follered
his trail fur about four mile, and I was one of them
what found him at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg&nbsp;411]</a></span>
&ldquo;He had lost his way,&rdquo; says Eric. &ldquo;I have seen the
spot&mdash;they call it Mitchell&rsquo;s Falls now&mdash;where he died. A
stream of considerable size plunges over a precipice of about
forty feet into a basin fourteen feet deep by as many wide.
Into this he fell, probably at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how was it possible to bring a dead body up these
steeps?&rdquo; Sylvia says, addressing Mr. Burnett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We brought it in a sheet slung to the top of stout
poles,&rdquo; he answers. &ldquo;Then it were carried down to Asheville,
and then brought up again, and buried there&rdquo;&mdash;he
nods to the peak above us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the warmth of their great friendship and admiration,
people thought that he ought to rest in the midst of the
scenes he had explored so fearlessly and loved so well,&rdquo;
says Eric.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Before long we gain
the top, and the first object on which our eyes rest is&mdash;the
grave.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Besides the grave, the summit is entirely bare.</p>

<p>The view is so immense that one is forced to regard it in
sections. Far to the north east lies Virginia, from which
the long waving line of the Blue Ridge comes, and passes
directly under the Black, making a point of junction, near
which it towers into the steep Pinnacle and stately Graybeard&mdash;so
called from the white beard which it wears when
a frozen cloud has iced its rhododendrons. From our greater
eminence we overlook the Blue Ridge entirely, and see the
country below spreading into azure distance, with white
spots which resolve themselves through the glasses into villages,
and mountains clearly defined. The Linville range&mdash;through
which the Linville River forces its way in a gorge
of wonderful grandeur&mdash;is in full view, with a misty cloud
lying on the surface of Table Rock, while the peculiar form
of the Hawk&rsquo;s Bill stands forth in marked relief. Beyond,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg&nbsp;412]</a></span>
blue and limitless as the ocean, the undulating plain of the
more level country extends until it melts into the sky.</p>

<p>As the glance leaves this view, and, sweeping back over
the Blue Ridge, follows the main ledge of the Black, one
begins to appreciate the magnitude of this great mountain.
For miles along its dark crest appear a succession of cone-like
peaks, and, as it sweeps around westwardly, it divides
into two great branches&mdash;one of which terminates in the
height on which we stand, while numerous spurs lead off
from its base; the other stretches southward, forming the
splendid chain of Craggy. At our feet lie the elevated
counties of Yancey and Mitchell, with their surfaces so
unevenly mountainous that one wonders how men could
have been daring enough to think of making their homes
amid such wild scenes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Beyond
these counties stretches the chain of the Unaka, running
along the line of Tennessee, with the Roan Mountain&mdash;famous
for its extensive view over seven states&mdash;immediately
in our front. Through the passes and rugged
chasms of this range, we look across the entire valley of
East Tennessee to where the blue outlines of the Cumberland
Mountains trend toward Kentucky, and we see distinctly
a marked depression which Eric says is Cumberland
Gap. Turning our gaze due westward, the view is, if possible,
still more grand. There the colossal masses of the
Great Smoky stand, draped in a mantle of clouds, while
through Haywood and Transylvania, to the borders of South
Carolina, rise the peaks of the Balsam Mountains, behind
which are the Cullowhee and the Nantahala, with the Blue
Ridge making a majestic curve toward the point where
Georgia touches the Carolinas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>It is enough to sit and watch the inexpressible beauty of

There is a sense of isolation, of solemnity and majesty, in
the scene which none of us are likely to forget. So high
are we elevated above the world that the pure vault of ether
over our heads seems nearer to us than the blue rolling earth,
with its wooded hills and smiling valleys below. No sound
comes up to us, no voice of water or note of bird breaks the
stillness. We are in the region of that eternal silence which
wraps the summits of the &ldquo;everlasting hills.&rdquo; A repose
that is full of awe broods over this lofty peak, which still
retains the last rays of the sinking sun, while over the lower
world twilight has fallen.</p>

<h2>HENRY WOODFEN GRADY.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1851=1889.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Henry Woodfen Grady</span> was born at Athens, Georgia,
and educated at the State University. He became an editor,
and in 1880 purchased an interest in the Atlanta &ldquo;Constitution&rdquo;
on whose staff he remained till his death. His
articles, addresses, and editorials made his name well known
throughout the country, and contributed no little to the
development of Southern industries after the war. A
monument has been erected to him in Atlanta.</p>

<p><i>Master and Slave.</i>&mdash;Perhaps no period of human history
has been more misjudged and less understood than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg&nbsp;415]</a></span>
slaveholding era in the South. Slavery as an institution cannot
be defended; but its administration was so nearly perfect
among our forefathers as to challenge and hold our loving
respect. It is doubtful if the world has seen a peasantry so
happy and so well-to-do as the negro slaves in America.
The world was amazed at the fidelity with which these
slaves guarded, from 1861 to 1865, the homes and families
of the masters who were fighting with the army that barred
their way to freedom. If &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; had portrayed
the rule of slavery rather than the rarest exception,
not all the armies that went to the field could have stayed
the flood of rapine and arson and pillage that would have
started with the first gun of the civil war. Instead of that,
witness the miracle of the slave in loyalty to his master,
closing the fetters upon his own limbs&mdash;maintaining and
defending the families of those who fought against his
freedom&mdash;and at night on the far-off battle-field searching
among the carnage for his young master, that he might lift
the dying head to his breast and bend to catch the last
words to the old folks at home, so wrestling the meantime
in agony and love that he would lay down his life in his
master&rsquo;s stead.</p>

<p>History has no parallel to the faith kept by the negro in
the South during the war. Often five hundred negroes to
a single white man, and yet through these dusky throngs
the women and children walked in safety, and the unprotected
homes rested in peace. Unmarshalled, the black
battalions moved patiently to the fields in the morning to
feed the armies their idleness would have starved, and at
night gathered anxiously at the &ldquo;big house to hear the news
from marster,&rdquo; though conscious that his victory made their
chains enduring. Everywhere humble and kindly. The
body-guard of the helpless. The rough companion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg&nbsp;416]</a></span>
little ones. The observant friend. The silent sentry in his
lowly cabin. The shrewd counsellor. And when the dead
came home, a mourner at the open grave. A thousand
torches would have disbanded every Southern army, but
not one was lighted. When the master, going to a war in
which slavery was involved, said to his slave, &ldquo;I leave my
home and loved ones in your charge,&rdquo; the tenderness
between man and master stood disclosed.</p>

<p>The Northern man, dealing with casual servants, querulous,
sensitive, and lodged for a day in a sphere they resent,
can hardly comprehend the friendliness and sympathy that
existed between the master and the slave. He cannot understand
how the negro stood in slavery days, open-hearted
and sympathetic, full of gossip and comradeship, the companion
of the hunt, frolic, furrow, and home, contented in
the kindly dependence that had been a habit of his blood,
and never lifting his eyes beyond the narrow horizon that
shut him in with his neighbors and friends. But this relation
did exist in the days of slavery. It was the rule of
that <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. It has survived war, and strife, and political
campaigns in which the drum-beat inspired and Federal
bayonets fortified. It will never die until the last slaveholder
and slave has been gathered to rest. It is the glory
of our past in the South. It is the answer to abuse and
slander. It is the hope of our future.</p>

<p><i>Ante-bellum Civilization.</i>&mdash;The relations of the races in
slavery must be clearly understood to understand what has
followed, and to judge of what is yet to come. Not less
important is it to have some clear idea of the civilization of
that period.</p>

<p>That was a peculiar society. Almost feudal in its splendor,
it was almost patriarchal in its simplicity. Leisure
and wealth gave it exquisite culture. Its wives and mothers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg&nbsp;417]</a></span>
exempt from drudgery, and almost from care, gave to their
sons, through patient and constant training, something of
their own grace and gentleness and to their homes beauty
and light. Its people, homogeneous by necessity, held
straight and simple faith, and were religious to a marked
degree along the old lines of Christian belief. This same
homogeneity bred a hospitality that was as kinsmen to
kinsmen, and that wasted at the threshold of every home
what the more frugal people of the North conserved and
invested in public charities.</p>

<p>The code duello furnished the highest appeal in dispute.
An affront to a lad was answered at the pistol&rsquo;s mouth.
The sense of quick responsibility tempered the tongues of
even the most violent, and the newspapers of South Carolina
for eight years, it is said, did not contain one abusive
word. The ownership of slaves, even more than of realty,
held families steadfast on their estates, and everywhere prevailed
the sociability of established neighborhoods. Money
counted least in making the social status, and constantly
ambitious and brilliant youngsters from no estate married
into the families of the planter princes. Meanwhile the
one character utterly condemned and ostracized was the man
who was mean to his slaves. Even the coward was pitied
and might have been liked. For the cruel master there was
no toleration.</p>

<p>The <i>ante-bellum</i> society had immense force. Working
under the slavery which brought the suspicion or hostility
of the world, and which practically beleaguered it within
walls, it yet accomplished good things. For the first sixty-four
years of the republic it furnished the president for
fifty-two years. Its statesmen demanded the war of 1812,
opened it with but five Northern senators supporting it, and
its general, Jackson, won the decisive battle of New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg&nbsp;418]</a></span>
Orleans. It was a Southern statesman who added the Louisiana
territory of more than 1,000,000 square miles to our
domain. Under a Southern statesman Florida was acquired
from Spain. Against the opposition of the free States, the
Southern influence forced the war with Mexico, and annexed
the superb empire of Texas, brought in New Mexico,
and opened the gates of the republic to the Pacific. Scott
and Taylor, the heroes of the Mexican war, were Southern
men. In material, as in political affairs, the old South was
masterful. The first important railroad operated in America
traversed Carolina. The first steamer that crossed the
ocean cleared from Savannah.</p>

<p>The first college established for girls was opened in
Georgia. No naturalist has surpassed Audubon; no geographer
equalled Maury; and Sims and McDonald led the
world of surgery in their respective lines. It was Crawford
Long, of Georgia, who gave to the world the priceless
blessing of an&aelig;sthesia.</p>

<p>The wealth accumulated by the people was marvellous.
And, though it is held that slavery enriched the few at the
general expense, Georgia and Carolina were the richest
States, per capita, in the Union in 1800, saving Rhode
Island. Some idea of the desolation of the war may be had
from the fact that, in spite of their late remarkable recuperation,
they are now, excepting Idaho, the poorest States,
per capita, in the Union. So rich was the South in 1860,
that Mr. Lincoln spoke but common sentiment when he
said: &ldquo;If we let the South go, where shall we get our
revenues?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In its engaging grace&mdash;in the chivalry that tempered
even Quixotism with dignity&mdash;in the piety that saved master
and slave alike&mdash;in the charity that boasted not&mdash;in the
honor held above estate&mdash;in the hospitality that neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg&nbsp;419]</a></span>
condescended nor cringed&mdash;in frankness and heartiness and
wholesome comradeship&mdash;in the reverence paid to womanhood
and the inviolable respect in which woman&rsquo;s name
was held&mdash;the civilization of the old slave <i>r&eacute;gime</i> in the
South has not been surpassed, and perhaps will not be
equalled, among men.</p>

<p>And as the fidelity of the slave during the war bespoke
the kindness of the master before the war, so the unquestioning
reverence with which the young men of the South
accepted, in 1865, their heritage of poverty and defeat,
proved the strength and excellence of the civilization from
which that heritage had come. In cheerfulness they bestirred
themselves amid the ashes and the wrecks, and,
holding the inspiration of their past to be better than their
rich acres and garnered wealth, went out to rebuild their
fallen fortunes, with never a word of complaint, nor the
thought of criticism!</p>

Mr. Page delineates finely the old Virginia darkey and
his dialect, as Mr. Harris does the darkey of the Carolinas
and Georgia. There is a marked difference between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The naturalness of his style, the skill with which he
uses seemingly indifferent incidents and sayings to trick out
and light up his pictures, the apparently unintentional and
therefore most effective touches of pathos, are uncommon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, jes&rsquo; den dey blowed boots an&rsquo; saddles, an&rsquo; we

Marse Chan&rsquo;s comp&rsquo;ny wuz de secon&rsquo;, an&rsquo; when we got

layin&rsquo; down dyar onder de cannons) our lines sort o&rsquo; broke
an&rsquo; stop; de cun&rsquo;l was kilt, an&rsquo; I b&rsquo;lieve dey wuz jes&rsquo; &rsquo;bout

hol&rsquo; de fleg, an&rsquo; hollers, &lsquo;Foller me!&rsquo; and rid strainin&rsquo; up de
hill &rsquo;mong de cannons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seen &rsquo;im when he went, de sorrel four good lengths
ahead o&rsquo; ev&rsquo;ry urr hoss, jes&rsquo; like he use&rsquo; to be in a fox-hunt,
an&rsquo; de whole rigiment right arfter &rsquo;im. Yo&rsquo; ain&rsquo; nuvver

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg&nbsp;422]</a></span>
Providence put de bank dyah, but how come Providence
nuver saved Marse Chan?</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I look &rsquo;roun&rsquo; de roan wuz lyin&rsquo; dyah by me, stone
dead, wid a cannon-ball gone &rsquo;mos&rsquo; th&rsquo;oo him, an&rsquo; our men

&rsquo;Twan&rsquo; mo&rsquo;n a minit, de sorrel come gallupin&rsquo; back wid his

<p>&ldquo;I jumped up an&rsquo; run over de bank, an&rsquo; dyar, wid a whole

wid de fleg still in he han&rsquo;, an&rsquo; a bullet right th&rsquo;oo he body,

<p class="caption">A Summer and Winter View of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn.</p>

<p>June had crossed the borders of Tennessee. Even on the
summit of Chilhowee Mountain the apples in Peter Giles&rsquo;
orchard were beginning to redden, and his Indian corn,
planted on so steep a declivity that the stalks seemed to
have much ado to keep their footing, was crested with tassels
and plumed with silk. Among the dense forests, seen
by no man&rsquo;s eye, the elder was flying its creamy banners in
honor of June&rsquo;s coming, and, heard by no man&rsquo;s ear, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg&nbsp;425]</a></span>
pink and white bells of the azalea rang out melodies of
welcome.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Then the two men tilted their chairs against the little
porch in front of Peter Giles&rsquo; log cabin, and puffed their
pipes in silence. The panorama spread out before them
showed misty and dreamy among the delicate spiral wreaths
of smoke. But was that gossamer-like illusion, lying upon
the far horizon, the magic of nicotian, or the vague presence
of distant heights? As ridge after ridge came down
from the sky in ever-graduating shades of intenser blue,
Peter Giles might have told you that this parallel system of
enchantment was only &ldquo;the mountings&rdquo;; that here was
Foxy, and there was Big Injun, and still beyond was
another, which he had &ldquo;hearn tell ran spang up into Virginny.&rdquo;
The sky that bent to clasp this kindred blue was
of varying moods. Floods of sunshine submerged Chilhowee
in liquid gold, and revealed that dainty outline limned
upon the northern horizon; but over the Great Smoky
mountains, clouds had gathered and a gigantic rainbow
bridged the valley.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Simon Burney did not speak for a
moment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a likely gal o&rsquo;
yourn,&rdquo; he drawled, with an odd constraint in his voice,&mdash;&ldquo;a
likely gal, that Clarsie.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Peter Giles at length replied, &ldquo;Clarsie air a likely
enough gal. But she air mightily sot ter havin&rsquo; her own
way. An&rsquo; ef &rsquo;t ain&rsquo;t give to her peaceable-like, she jes&rsquo;
takes it, whether or no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This statement, made by one presumably informed on the
subject, might have damped the ardor of many a suitor,&mdash;for
the monstrous truth was dawning on Peter Giles&rsquo;s mind
that suitor was the position to which this slow elderly
widower aspired. But Simon Burney, with that odd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg&nbsp;426]</a></span>
all-pervading constraint still prominently apparent, mildly
observed, &ldquo;Waal, ez much ez I hev seen of her goin&rsquo;s-on, it
&rsquo;pears ter me az her way air a mighty good way. An&rsquo; it
ain&rsquo;t comical that she likes it.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The song grew momentarily more
distinct: among the leaves there were fugitive glimpses of
blue and white, and at last Clarsie appeared, walking
lightly along the log, clad in her checked homespun dress,
and with a pail upon her head.</p>

<p>She was a tall lithe girl, with that delicately transparent
complexion often seen among the women of these mountains.
Her lustreless black hair lay along her forehead
without a ripple or a wave; there was something in the
expression of her large eyes that suggested those of a
deer,&mdash;something free, untamable, and yet gentle. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
no wonder ter me ez Clarsie is all tuk up with the wild things,
an&rsquo; critters ginerally,&rdquo; her mother was wont to say; &ldquo;she
sorter looks like &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;m a-thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she came in sight there was a renewal of that odd
constraint in Simon Burney&rsquo;s face and manner, and he rose
abruptly. &ldquo;Waal,&rdquo; he said, hastily, going to his horse, a
raw-boned sorrel, hitched to the fence, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about time I
war a-startin&rsquo; home, I reckons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded to his host, who silently nodded in return, and
the old horse jogged off with him down the road, as Clarsie
entered the house and placed the pail upon a shelf.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The breeze freshened, after the sun went down,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
there were stars in the night besides those
known to astronomers; the stellular fire-flies gemmed the
black shadows with a fluctuating brilliancy; they circled
in and out of the porch, and touched the leaves above Clarsie&rsquo;s
head with quivering points of light. A steadier and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg&nbsp;427]</a></span>
an intenser gleam was advancing along the road, and the
sound of languid footsteps came with it; the aroma of
tobacco graced the atmosphere, and a tall figure walked up
to the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; said Peter Giles, rising, and tendering
the guest a chair. &ldquo;Ye air Tom Pratt, ez well ez I kin
make out by this light. Waal, Tom, we hain&rsquo;t furgot ye
sence ye done been hyar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The young man took leave presently, in great depression
of spirits.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Clarsie ascended the
ladder to a nook in the roof which she called her room.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life her slumber was fitful and
restless, long intervals of wakefulness alternating with
snatches of fantastic dreams.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
then her mind reverted to Tom Pratt, to old Simon Burney,
and to her mother&rsquo;s emphatic and oracular declaration that
widowers are in league with Satan, and that the girls upon
whom they cast the eye of supernatural fascination have no
choice in the matter. &ldquo;I wish I knowed ef that thar sayin&rsquo;
war true,&rdquo; she murmured, her face still turned to the western
spurs, and the moon sinking slowly toward them.</p>

<p>With a sudden resolution she rose to her feet. She knew
a way of telling fortunes which was, according to tradition,
infallible, and she determined to try it, and ease her mind as
to her future. Now was the propitious moment. &ldquo;I hev
always hearn that it won&rsquo;t come true &rsquo;thout ye try it jes&rsquo;
before daybreak, an&rsquo; kneelin&rsquo; down at the forks of the road.&rdquo;
She hesitated a moment and listened intently. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d
never git done a-laffin&rsquo; at me, ef they fund it out,&rdquo; she
thought.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [She went out into the
road.] She fixed her eyes upon the mystic sphere dropping
down the sky, knelt among the azaleas at the forks of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg&nbsp;428]</a></span>
road, and repeated the time-honored invocation: &ldquo;Ef I&rsquo;m
a-goin&rsquo; ter marry a young man, whistle, Bird, whistle. Ef
I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; ter marry an old man, low, Cow, low. Ef I
ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; ter marry nobody, knock, Death, knock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a prolonged silence in the matutinal freshness
and perfume of the woods. She raised her head, and listened
attentively. No chirp of half-awakened bird, no
tapping of wood-pecker or the mysterious death-watch;
but from far along the dewy aisles of the forest, the ungrateful
Spot that Clarsie had fed more faithfully than herself,
lifted up her voice, and set the echoes vibrating.
Clarsie, however, had hardly time for a pang of disappointment.</p>

<p>While she still knelt among the azaleas, her large deer-like
eyes were suddenly dilated with terror. From around the
curve of the road came the quick beat of hastening footsteps,
the sobbing sound of panting breath, and between
her and the sinking moon there passed an attenuated one-armed
figure, with a pallid sharpened face, outlined for a
moment on its brilliant disk, and dreadful starting eyes, and
quivering open mouth. It disappeared in an instant among
the shadows of the laurel, and Clarsie, with a horrible fear
clutching at her heart, sprang to her feet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the ghost stood before her. She could not nerve herself to
run past him, and he was directly in her way homeward.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye do ez ye air bid, or it&rsquo;ll be the worse for ye,&rdquo; said
the &ldquo;harnt&rdquo; in a quivering shrill tone. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s hunger in
the nex&rsquo; worl&rsquo; ez well ez in this, an&rsquo; ye bring me some vittles
hyar this time ter-morrer, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t ye tell nobody ye
hev seen me, nuther, or it&rsquo;ll be the worse for ye.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The next morning, before the moon sank, Clarsie, with a
tin pail in her hand, went to meet the ghost at the appointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg&nbsp;429]</a></span>
place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Morning was close at
hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the leaves fell into abrupt
commotion, and he was standing in the road, beside her.
He did not speak, but watched her with an eager, questioning
intentness, as she placed the contents of the pail upon
the moss at the roadside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo; agin ter-morrer,&rdquo;
she said, gently.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then she slowly
walked along her misty way in the dim light of the coming
dawn. There was a footstep in the road behind her; she
thought it was the ghost once more. She turned, and met
Simon Burney, face to face. His rod was on his shoulder,
and a string of fish was in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye air a-doin&rsquo; wrongful, Clarsie,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;It
air agin the law fur folks ter feed an&rsquo; shelter them ez is
a-runnin&rsquo; from jestice. An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll git yerself inter trouble.
Other folks will find ye out, besides me, an&rsquo; then the sheriff
&rsquo;ll be up hyar arter ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tears rose to Clarsie&rsquo;s eyes. This prospect was infinitely
more terrifying than the awful doom which follows
the horror of a ghost&rsquo;s speech. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she said,
however, doggedly swinging the pail back and forth. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t gin my consent ter starvin&rsquo; of folks, even if they air
a-hidin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-runnin&rsquo; from jestice.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h2>AM&Eacute;LIE RIVES CHANLER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chanler</span>, or <span class="smcap">Am&eacute;lie Rives</span> as she still styles herself
in writing, was born in Richmond, Virginia, but passed
her early life at the family place in Albemarle County,
called &ldquo;Castle Hill.&rdquo; She is a granddaughter of William
Cabell Rives, once minister to France and author of &ldquo;Life
of Madison&rdquo;; and her grandmother, Mrs. Judith Walker
Rives, was a woman of much ability, and left some writings
entitled &ldquo;Home and the World,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Residence in
Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was married in 1888 to Mr. John Armstrong Chanler
of New York and has since spent much time in Paris, studying
painting for which she has as great fondness as for
writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg&nbsp;432]</a></span>

Pebworth.&rdquo; They created a sensation as they came out
and were said to be the work of a girl under twenty. She

<p>Gilman was driving along one of the well-kept turnpikes
that wind about the Warm Springs Valley. He
recognized the austere and solemn beauty that hemmed him
in from the far-off outer world; but at the same time he
was contrasting it with the sea-coast of his native State,
Massachusetts, and a certain creeping homesickness began
to rise about his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg&nbsp;433]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to this, he had left his delicate wife suffering
with an acute neuralgic headache, and also saddened by a
yearning for the picturesque old farm-house in which he
had been born, and where they had lived during the first
year of marriage. The trap which Gilman drove was filled
with surveying instruments, and, as he turned into the
rough mountain road, which led towards the site of the new
railway for which he was now prospecting, the smaller ones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg&nbsp;434]</a></span>
began to rattle together and slide from the seat beside him.
Finally, as the cart slipped against a stone, the level
bounced into a puddle. He was about to jump out when a
bold, ringing voice called to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set still&mdash;A&rsquo;ll pick hit up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a figure slid down the rocky bank at his right, her
one garment wrinkling from her bare, sturdy legs during
the performance.</p>

<p>Gilman had never seen anything like her in his thirty
years of varied experience.</p>

<p>She was very tall. A curtain of rough, glittering curls
hung to her knees. Her face, clear with that clearness
which only a mountain wind can bring, was white as a seagull&rsquo;s
breast, except where a dark, yet vivid pink melted
into the blue veins on her temples and throat. Her round,
fresh lips, smooth as a peony-leaf, were parted in a wide
laugh, over teeth large and yellow-white, like the grains on
an ear of corn. She wore a loose tunic of blue-gray stuff,
which reached to the middle of her legs, covered with grass
stains and patches of mould. Her bare feet, somewhat
broadened by walking, were well-shaped, the great toe
standing apart from the others, the strong, round ankles,
although scratched and bruised, perfectly symmetrical.
Her arms, bare almost to the shoulder, were like those with
which in imagination we complete the Milo. Eyes, round
and colored like the edges of broken glass, looked out
boldly from under her long black eyebrows. Her nose was
straight and well cut, but set impertinently.</p>

<p>As she picked up the muddy level she laughed boisterously
and wiped it on her frock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Gilman, and then, after a second&rsquo;s
hesitation, added: &ldquo;Where are you going? Perhaps I can
give you a lift on your way? Will you get in?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg&nbsp;435]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, a done keer ef a do,&rdquo; she said, still staring at him.</p>

<p>She got in and took the level on her knee, then burst out
laughing again&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A reckon yuh wonders what a&rsquo;m a haw-hawin&rsquo; at?&rdquo;
she asked, suddenly. &ldquo;Well, a&rsquo;ll tell yuh! &rsquo;Tiz case a
feels jess like this hyuh contrapshun o&rsquo; yourn. A haint hed
a bite sence five this mawnin&rsquo;, and a&rsquo;ve got a bubble in th&rsquo;
middle o&rsquo; me, a ken tell yuh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She opened her flexible mouth almost to her ears, showing
both rows of speckless teeth, and roaring mirthfully
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some sandwiches, here&mdash;won&rsquo;t you have one?&rdquo;
said Gilman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dunno&mdash;what be they?&rdquo; she asked, rather suspiciously,
eyeing him sidewise.</p>

<p>He explained to her, and she accepted one, tearing from
it a huge semi-circle, which she held in her cheek while
exclaiming:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murder! hain&rsquo;t that good, though? D&rsquo;yuh eat them
things ev&rsquo;y day? Yuh looks hit! You&rsquo;re a real fine-lookin&rsquo;
feller&mdash;mos&rsquo; ez good-lookin&rsquo; ez Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Bill?&rdquo; asked Gilman, much interested in this,
his first conversation with a genuine savage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bill? he&rsquo;s muh pard, an&rsquo; muh brother, too. I come down
hyuh tuh git him a drink o&rsquo; water, but a hain&rsquo;t foun&rsquo; a spring
yit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t one in several miles,&rdquo; said Gilman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hyuh!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Lemme git out.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And she was out, with the bound of a deer. &ldquo;You g&rsquo;long,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;a&rsquo;m sorry a rode this far wi&rsquo; you. You&rsquo;ll larf
&rsquo;bout muh bar foots, an&rsquo; this hyuh rag o&rsquo; mine, wi&rsquo; them po&rsquo;
white trash an&rsquo; niggers. Whar you fum, anyhow? You
hain&rsquo;t a Fuginia feller. A kin tell by yo&rsquo; talk. You called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg&nbsp;436]</a></span>
roots &lsquo;ruts&rsquo; jess now, an&rsquo; yuh said we&rsquo;d &lsquo;sun&rsquo; be whar them
other fellers be. Whar you fum?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Massachusetts,&rdquo; said Gilman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;that another langidge fuh some name a knows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;it&rsquo;s the real name of another State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hit&rsquo;s &rsquo;nuff tuh twis&rsquo; a body&rsquo;s tongue, fuh life, so a
done blame yuh s&rsquo;much fuh yo&rsquo; funny talk. Mawnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
And she began to swing herself upon a great lichen-crested
boulder by the roadside.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Gilman was naturally curious as to the type of the young
barbarian whom he had met on his drive to Black Creek,
and, during a pause in his work, he told a young fellow
named Watkins of his adventure, and asked him to what
class the girl belonged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon, sir, she was a sang-digger,&rdquo; said Watkins,
laughing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a awful wild lot, mostly bad as they
make &rsquo;em, with no more idea of right an&rsquo; wrong than a lot
o&rsquo; ground-horgs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is a &lsquo;sang-digger&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Gilman, more and
more curious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, sang, or ginseng, ez the real name is, is a
sorter root that grows thick in the mountains about here.
They make some sorter medicine outer it. I&rsquo;ve chawed it
myself for heartburn. It&rsquo;s right paying, too&mdash;sang-digging
is, sir; you ken git at least a dollar a pound for it, an&rsquo;
sometimes you ken dig ten pounds in a day, but that&rsquo;s right
seldom. Two or three pounds a day is doin&rsquo; well. They&rsquo;re
a awful low set, sir, sang-diggers is. We call &rsquo;em &lsquo;snakes&rsquo;
hereabouts, &rsquo;cause they don&rsquo;t have no place to live cep&rsquo;in&rsquo; in
winter, and then they go off somewhere or ruther, to their
huts. But in the summer and early autumn they stop where
night ketches &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; light a fire an&rsquo; sleep &rsquo;round it. They
cert&rsquo;n&rsquo;y are a bad lot, sir. They&rsquo;ll steal a sheep or a horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg&nbsp;437]</a></span>
ez quick ez winkin&rsquo;. Why, t&rsquo;want a year ago that they stole a
mighty pretty mare o&rsquo; mine, that I set a heap by, an&rsquo; rid off
her tail an&rsquo; mane a-tearin&rsquo; through the brush with her. She
got loose somehow an&rsquo; come back to me. But they stole
two horses for ole Mr. Hawkins, down near Fallin&rsquo; Springs,
an&rsquo; he a&rsquo;in&rsquo;t been able to git &rsquo;em back. There&rsquo;s awful murders
an&rsquo; villainies done by &rsquo;em. But some o&rsquo; them sang-digger
gals is awful pretty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes,
sir, I reckon she was a sang-digger, sure enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[This wild creature of the woods was treated kindly by
Gilman and his wife, and she finally sacrificed herself to
save Mrs. Gilman.]</p>

<p>That was what she was called by everybody as soon as
she was seen or described. Her name, besides baptismal
titles, was Idalie Sainte Foy Mortemart des Islets. When
she came into society, in the brilliant little world of New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg&nbsp;438]</a></span>
Orleans, it was the event of the season, and after she came
in, whatever she did became also events. Whether she
went, or did not go; what she said, or did not say; what
she wore, and did not wear&mdash;all these became important matters
of discussion, quoted as much or more than what the
President said, or the governor thought. And in those
days, the days of &rsquo;59, New Orleans was not, as it is now,
a one-heiress place, but it may be said that one could find
heiresses then as one finds type-writing girls now.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Idalie received her birth and what education
she had on her parent&rsquo;s plantation, the famed old Reine
Sainte Foy place, and it is no secret that, like the ancient
kings of France, her birth exceeded her education.</p>

<p>It was a plantation, the Reine Sainte Foy, the richness
and luxury of which are really well described in those perfervid
pictures of tropical life, at one time the passion of
philanthropic imaginations, excited and exciting over the
horrors of slavery. Although these pictures were then
often accused of being purposely exaggerated, they seem
now to fall short of, instead of surpassing, the truth.
Stately walls, acres of roses, miles of oranges, unmeasured
fields of cane, colossal sugar-house&mdash;they were all there,
and all the rest of it, with the slaves, slaves, slaves everywhere,
whole villages of negro cabins. And there were
also, most noticeable to the natural, as well as visionary
eye&mdash;there were the ease, idleness, extravagance, self-indulgence,
pomp, pride, arrogance, in short the whole enumeration,
the moral <i>sine qua non</i>, as some people considered it,
of the wealthy slaveholder of aristocratic descent and tastes.</p>

<p>What Mademoiselle Idalie cared to learn she studied, what
she did not she ignored; and she followed the same simple
rule untrammeled in her eating, drinking, dressing, and comportment
generally; and whatever discipline may have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg&nbsp;439]</a></span>
exercised on the place, either in fact or fiction, most assuredly
none of it, even so much as in a threat, ever attainted her
sacred person. When she was just turned sixteen, Mademoiselle
Idalie made up her mind to go into society.
Whether she was beautiful or not, it is hard to say. It is
almost impossible to appreciate properly the beauty of the
rich, the very rich. The unfettered development, the limitless
choice of accessories, the confidence, the self-esteem,
the sureness of expression, the simplicity of purpose, the
ease of execution,&mdash;all these produce a certain effect of
beauty behind which one really cannot get to measure
length of nose, or brilliancy of the eye. This much can be
said; there was nothing in her that positively contradicted
any assumption of beauty on her part, or credit of it on the
part of others. She was very tall and very thin with small
head, long neck, black eyes, and abundant straight black
hair,&mdash;for which her hair-dresser deserved more praise than
she,&mdash;good teeth of course, and a mouth that, even in
prayer, talked nothing but commands; that is about all she
had <i>en fait d&rsquo;ornements</i>, as the modistes say. It may be
added that she walked as if the Reine Sainte Foy plantation
extended over the whole earth, and the soil of it were too
vile for her tread.</p>

<p>Of course she did not buy her toilets in New Orleans.
Everything was ordered from Paris, and came as regularly
through the custom-house as the modes and robes to the
milliners. She was furnished by a certain house there, just
as one of a royal family would be at the present day. As
this had lasted from her layette up to her sixteenth year, it
may be imagined what took place when she determined to
make her d&eacute;but. Then it was literally, not metaphorically,
<i>carte blanche</i>, at least so it got to the ears of society. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg&nbsp;440]</a></span>
took a sheet of note-paper, wrote the date at the top, added
&ldquo;I make my d&eacute;but in November,&rdquo; signed her name at the
extreme end of the sheet, addressed it to her dressmaker in
Paris, and sent it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>That she was admired, raved about, loved even, goes
without saying. After the first month she held the refusal
of half the beaux of New Orleans. Men did absurd, undignified,
preposterous things for her: and she? Love?
Marry? The idea never occurred to her. She treated the
most exquisite of her pretenders no better than she treated
her Paris gowns, for the matter of that. She could not
even bring herself to listen to a proposal patiently; whistling
to her dogs, in the middle of the most ardent protestations,
or jumping up and walking away with a shrug of the
shoulders, and a &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well! every one knows what happened after &rsquo;59. There
is no need to repeat. The history of one is the history of
all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>It might have been ten years according to some calculations,
or ten eternities,&mdash;the heart and the almanac never
agree about time,&mdash;but one morning old Champigny (they
used to call him Champignon) was walking along his levee
front&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when he saw a figure approaching.
He had to stop to look at it, for it was worth
while. The head was hidden by a green barege veil, which
the showers had plentifully besprinkled with dew; a tall
thin figure.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She was the teacher
of the colored school some three or four miles away. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;
thought Champigny, &ldquo;some Northern lady on a mission.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Old Champigny could not get over it
that he had never seen her before. But he must have seen
her, and, with his abstraction and old age, not have noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg&nbsp;441]</a></span>
her, for he found out from the negroes that she had been
teaching four or five years there. And he found out also&mdash;how,
it is not important&mdash;that she was Idalie Sainte Foy
Mortemart des Islets. <i>La grande demoiselle!</i> He had
never known her in the old days, owing to his uncomplimentary
attitude toward women, but he knew of her, of
course, and of her family.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Only the good God himself knows what passed in Champigny&rsquo;s
mind on the subject. We know only the results.
He went and married <i>la grande demoiselle</i>. How? Only
the good God knows that too.</p>

<h2>WAITMAN BARBE.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>1864= &mdash;&mdash;.</b></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Waitman Barbe</span> was born at Morgantown, West Virginia,
and educated at the State University in that town.
Since the year 1884 he has been engaged in editorial and
literary pursuits, being now editor of the <i>Daily State Journal</i>.
He has already made a reputation as a speaker on literary
and educational topics: and his poems, first appearing
in periodicals, have now been collected into a volume called
&ldquo;Ashes and Incense,&rdquo; the first edition of which was exhausted
in six months. It &ldquo;has put him among the foremost
of the young American poets.&rdquo; Edmund Clarence
Stedman says of it: &ldquo;There is real poetry in the book&mdash;a
voice worth owning and exercising. I am struck with the
beauty and feeling of the lyrics which I have read&mdash;such,
for example, as the stanzas on Lanier and &lsquo;The Comrade
Hills.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>QUESTIONS.</h2>


<p>These questions are not recommended as essential, but merely as suggestive
and perhaps useful to teachers who prefer the Socratic method. They might
also serve to call the attention of students to some point which they would
otherwise overlook.</p>

<p>The general questions and those in ordinary type may be answered from the
text itself; the answers to those in italics are to be found in other parts of the
book, in a history of the United States, or in a cyclopedia. The questions in
italics may of course, like all the rest, be omitted at the discretion of the
teacher. The research required to answer such questions, however, will be of
great value to the students, if they have the time for it. See also the suggestions
given in the Preface.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">General Questions.</h3>

<p>These questions apply to all the authors, and hence will not be repeated
under each name.</p>

was the author born? 3. Where did he pass his life? 4. What was his education?

<p>Most references to the death date of St. George H. Tucker in the book give a year of 1863; however, the information
about his death on page <a href="#Page_329">329</a> notes that he died in the Seven Days' Battles around Richmond in
1862. Since an alternative source for the date of his death could not be found, all dates remain as printed.</p>

<p>Illustrations have been moved slightly, where necessary, so that they are not in the middle of a paragraph.</p>
